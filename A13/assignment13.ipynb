      "vast arched bone of the whale's jaw, so wide, a coach might almost drive\r\n",
      "beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old decanters,\r\n",

      "Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about\r\n",
      "a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of SKRIMSHANDER. I\r\n",
      "sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with a\r\n",
      "room, received for answer that his house was full--not a bed unoccupied.\r\n",
      "\"But avast,\" he added, tapping his forehead, \"you haint no objections\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should\r\n",
      "ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and\r\n",
      "that if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the\r\n",
      "harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander\r\n",
      "further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with\r\n",
      "the half of any decent man's blanket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?--you want supper?\r\n",
      "Supper'll be ready directly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the\r\n",
      "Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with\r\n",
      "his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space\r\n",
      "between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but\r\n",
      "he didn't make much headway, I thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an\r\n",
      "adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland--no fire at all--the landlord\r\n",
      "said he couldn't afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each\r\n",
      "in a winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and\r\n",
      "hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But\r\n",
      "the fare was of the most substantial kind--not only meat and potatoes,\r\n",
      "but dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in\r\n",
      "a green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful\r\n",
      "manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My boy,\" said the landlord, \"you'll have the nightmare to a dead\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" I whispered, \"that aint the harpooneer is it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, no,\" said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, \"the harpooneer\r\n",

      "nothing but steaks, and he likes 'em rare.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The devil he does,\" says I. \"Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll be here afore long,\" was the answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this \"dark\r\n",

      "as a looker on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord\r\n",
      "cried, \"That's the Grampus's crew. I seed her reported in the offing\r\n",
      "this morning; a three years' voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now\r\n",
      "we'll have the latest news from the Feegees.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung open,\r\n",
      "and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their shaggy\r\n",
      "watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters, all\r\n",
      "bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they seemed an\r\n",
      "eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from their boat,\r\n",
      "and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then, that they\r\n",
      "made a straight wake for the whale's mouth--the bar--when the wrinkled\r\n",
      "little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out brimmers all\r\n",
      "round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon which Jonah\r\n",
      "mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he swore was a\r\n",
      "sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never mind of how\r\n",
      "long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador, or on the\r\n",
      "weather side of an ice-island.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even\r\n",
      "with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began capering\r\n",
      "about most obstreperously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though\r\n",
      "he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own\r\n",
      "sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise\r\n",
      "as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the sea-gods\r\n",
      "had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though but a\r\n",
      "sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I will\r\n",
      "here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six feet\r\n",
      "in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I have\r\n",
      "seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and burnt,\r\n",
      "making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep\r\n",
      "shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give\r\n",
      "him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner,\r\n",
      "and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of those tall\r\n",
      "mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When the revelry\r\n",
      "of his companions had mounted to its height, this man slipped away\r\n",
      "unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the\r\n",
      "sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his shipmates, and\r\n",
      "being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with them, they raised\r\n",
      "a cry of \"Bulkington! Bulkington! where's Bulkington?\" and darted out of\r\n",
      "the house in pursuit of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now about nine o'clock, and the room seeming almost\r\n",
      "supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself\r\n",
      "upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance\r\n",
      "of the seamen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal\r\n",
      "rather not sleep with your own brother. I don't know how it is, but\r\n",
      "people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to\r\n",
      "sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange\r\n",
      "town, and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely\r\n",
      "multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should\r\n",
      "sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep\r\n",
      "two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they\r\n",
      "all sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and\r\n",
      "cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the\r\n",
      "thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a\r\n",
      "harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of\r\n",
      "the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.\r\n",
      "Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be\r\n",
      "home and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at\r\n",
      "midnight--how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord! I've changed my mind about that harpooneer.--I shan't sleep\r\n",
      "with him. I'll try the bench here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just as you please; I'm sorry I cant spare ye a tablecloth for a\r\n",
      "mattress, and it's a plaguy rough board here\"--feeling of the knots and\r\n",
      "notches. \"But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I've got a carpenter's plane\r\n",
      "there in the bar--wait, I say, and I'll make ye snug enough.\" So saying\r\n",
      "he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting\r\n",
      "the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning\r\n",
      "like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the\r\n",
      "plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was\r\n",
      "near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven's sake to quit--the\r\n",
      "bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing\r\n",
      "in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the\r\n",
      "shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in\r\n",
      "the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a\r\n",
      "brown study.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too\r\n",
      "short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too\r\n",
      "narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher\r\n",
      "than the planed one--so there was no yoking them. I then placed the\r\n",
      "first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,\r\n",
      "leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I\r\n",
      "soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under\r\n",
      "the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all, especially\r\n",
      "as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window,\r\n",
      "and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate\r\n",
      "vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn't I steal\r\n",
      "a march on him--bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be\r\n",
      "wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon\r\n",
      "second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next\r\n",
      "morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be\r\n",
      "standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of spending\r\n",
      "a sufferable night unless in some other person's bed, I began to think\r\n",
      "that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against\r\n",
      "this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I'll wait awhile; he must be dropping\r\n",
      "in before long. I'll have a good look at him then, and perhaps we may\r\n",
      "become jolly good bedfellows after all--there's no telling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,\r\n",
      "and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord!\" said I, \"what sort of a chap is he--does he always keep such\r\n",
      "late hours?\" It was now hard upon twelve o'clock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to\r\n",
      "be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. \"No,\" he\r\n",
      "answered, \"generally he's an early bird--airley to bed and airley to\r\n",
      "rise--yes, he's the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out\r\n",
      "a peddling, you see, and I don't see what on airth keeps him so late,\r\n",
      "unless, may be, he can't sell his head.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can't sell his head?--What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you\r\n",
      "are telling me?\" getting into a towering rage. \"Do you pretend to say,\r\n",
      "landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday\r\n",
      "night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around this town?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's precisely it,\" said the landlord, \"and I told him he couldn't\r\n",
      "sell it here, the market's overstocked.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With what?\" shouted I.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With heads to be sure; ain't there too many heads in the world?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I tell you what it is, landlord,\" said I quite calmly, \"you'd better\r\n",
      "stop spinning that yarn to me--I'm not green.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"May be not,\" taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, \"but I\r\n",
      "rayther guess you'll be done BROWN if that ere harpooneer hears you a\r\n",
      "slanderin' his head.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'll break it for him,\" said I, now flying into a passion again at this\r\n",
      "unaccountable farrago of the landlord's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's broke a'ready,\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Broke,\" said I--\"BROKE, do you mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sartain, and that's the very reason he can't sell it, I guess.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a\r\n",
      "snow-storm--\"landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one\r\n",
      "another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a\r\n",
      "bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half\r\n",
      "belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I\r\n",
      "have not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and\r\n",
      "exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling\r\n",
      "towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow--a sort of connexion,\r\n",
      "landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest\r\n",
      "degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this\r\n",
      "harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the\r\n",
      "night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay\r\n",
      "that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good\r\n",
      "evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I've no idea of sleeping\r\n",
      "with a madman; and you, sir, YOU I mean, landlord, YOU, sir, by trying\r\n",
      "to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render yourself liable to\r\n",
      "a criminal prosecution.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Wall,\" said the landlord, fetching a long breath, \"that's a purty long\r\n",
      "sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be easy,\r\n",
      "this here harpooneer I have been tellin' you of has just arrived from\r\n",
      "the south seas, where he bought up a lot of 'balmed New Zealand heads\r\n",
      "(great curios, you know), and he's sold all on 'em but one, and that one\r\n",
      "he's trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow's Sunday, and it would not\r\n",
      "do to be sellin' human heads about the streets when folks is goin' to\r\n",
      "churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as he was\r\n",
      "goin' out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for all the\r\n",
      "airth like a string of inions.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed\r\n",
      "that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me--but at\r\n",
      "the same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a\r\n",
      "Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal\r\n",
      "business as selling the heads of dead idolators?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He pays reg'lar,\" was the rejoinder. \"But come, it's getting dreadful\r\n",
      "late, you had better be turning flukes--it's a nice bed; Sal and me\r\n",
      "slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There's plenty of room\r\n",
      "for two to kick about in that bed; it's an almighty big bed that. Why,\r\n",
      "afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the\r\n",
      "foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and\r\n",
      "somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.\r\n",
      "Arter that, Sal said it wouldn't do. Come along here, I'll give ye a\r\n",
      "glim in a jiffy;\" and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards\r\n",
      "me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a\r\n",
      "clock in the corner, he exclaimed \"I vum it's Sunday--you won't see that\r\n",
      "harpooneer to-night; he's come to anchor somewhere--come along then; DO\r\n",
      "come; WON'T ye come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was\r\n",
      "ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,\r\n",
      "with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers\r\n",
      "to sleep abreast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There,\" said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest\r\n",
      "that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; \"there, make\r\n",
      "yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.\" I turned round from\r\n",
      "eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of the\r\n",
      "most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then glanced\r\n",
      "round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table, could see\r\n",
      "no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf, the four\r\n",
      "walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale. Of\r\n",
      "things not properly belonging to the room, there was a hammock lashed\r\n",
      "up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a large seaman's bag,\r\n",
      "containing the harpooneer's wardrobe, no doubt in lieu of a land trunk.\r\n",
      "Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf\r\n",
      "over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the\r\n",
      "light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to arrive\r\n",
      "at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it to\r\n",
      "nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little\r\n",
      "tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an\r\n",
      "Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat,\r\n",
      "as you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible\r\n",
      "that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the\r\n",
      "streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to try\r\n",
      "it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy and\r\n",
      "thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious harpooneer\r\n",
      "had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit of glass\r\n",
      "stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my life. I tore\r\n",
      "myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink in the neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this\r\n",
      "head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on\r\n",
      "the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in\r\n",
      "the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought\r\n",
      "a little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,\r\n",
      "half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about\r\n",
      "the harpooneer's not coming home at all that night, it being so very\r\n",
      "late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots, and\r\n",
      "then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself to the\r\n",
      "care of heaven.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,\r\n",
      "there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not sleep\r\n",
      "for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had pretty\r\n",
      "nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard a heavy\r\n",
      "footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into the room\r\n",
      "from under the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal\r\n",
      "head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word\r\n",
      "till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\r\n",
      "Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\r\n",
      "looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the\r\n",
      "floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords\r\n",
      "of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all\r\n",
      "eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while\r\n",
      "employed in unlacing the bag's mouth. This accomplished, however, he\r\n",
      "turned round--when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of\r\n",
      "a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large\r\n",
      "blackish looking squares. Yes, it's just as I thought, he's a terrible\r\n",
      "bedfellow; he's been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is,\r\n",
      "just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his face\r\n",
      "so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be\r\n",
      "sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were\r\n",
      "stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;\r\n",
      "but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story of\r\n",
      "a white man--a whaleman too--who, falling among the cannibals, had been\r\n",
      "tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course of his\r\n",
      "distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And what is it,\r\n",
      "thought I, after all! It's only his outside; a man can be honest in any\r\n",
      "sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly complexion, that\r\n",
      "part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely independent of the\r\n",
      "squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be nothing but a good coat of\r\n",
      "tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot sun's tanning a white man\r\n",
      "into a purplish yellow one. However, I had never been in the South Seas;\r\n",
      "and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the\r\n",
      "skin. Now, while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning,\r\n",
      "this harpooneer never noticed me at all. But, after some difficulty\r\n",
      "having opened his bag, he commenced fumbling in it, and presently pulled\r\n",
      "out a sort of tomahawk, and a seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing\r\n",
      "these on the old chest in the middle of the room, he then took the New\r\n",
      "Zealand head--a ghastly thing enough--and crammed it down into the bag.\r\n",
      "He now took off his hat--a new beaver hat--when I came nigh singing out\r\n",
      "with fresh surprise. There was no hair on his head--none to speak of at\r\n",
      "least--nothing but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His\r\n",
      "bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull.\r\n",
      "Had not the stranger stood between me and the door, I would have bolted\r\n",
      "out of it quicker than ever I bolted a dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but\r\n",
      "it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of\r\n",
      "this head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.\r\n",
      "Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and\r\n",
      "confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of him\r\n",
      "as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at\r\n",
      "the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not\r\n",
      "game enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer\r\n",
      "concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed\r\n",
      "his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were checkered\r\n",
      "with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all over the same\r\n",
      "dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years' War, and just\r\n",
      "escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still more, his very\r\n",
      "legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up\r\n",
      "the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that he must be some\r\n",
      "abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the South\r\n",
      "Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to think of it.\r\n",
      "A peddler of heads too--perhaps the heads of his own brothers. He might\r\n",
      "take a fancy to mine--heavens! look at that tomahawk!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about\r\n",
      "something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me that\r\n",
      "he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall, or\r\n",
      "dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in the\r\n",
      "pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image with\r\n",
      "a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days' old Congo\r\n",
      "baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought that\r\n",
      "this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner. But\r\n",
      "seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened a good deal\r\n",
      "like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden\r\n",
      "idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage goes up to the\r\n",
      "empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board, sets up this\r\n",
      "little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the andirons. The\r\n",
      "chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty, so that I\r\n",
      "thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel\r\n",
      "for his Congo idol.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but\r\n",
      "ill at ease meantime--to see what was next to follow. First he takes\r\n",
      "about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places\r\n",
      "them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on\r\n",
      "top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into\r\n",
      "a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the fire,\r\n",
      "and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed to be\r\n",
      "scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit;\r\n",
      "then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite offer of\r\n",
      "it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to fancy such\r\n",
      "dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these strange\r\n",
      "antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the\r\n",
      "devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing some\r\n",
      "pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in the\r\n",
      "most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the idol\r\n",
      "up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket as\r\n",
      "carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and\r\n",
      "seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business\r\n",
      "operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,\r\n",
      "now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which\r\n",
      "I had so long been bound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.\r\n",
      "Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for an\r\n",
      "instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the handle,\r\n",
      "he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment the light\r\n",
      "was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between his teeth,\r\n",
      "sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it now; and giving\r\n",
      "a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him\r\n",
      "against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might\r\n",
      "be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his\r\n",
      "guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my\r\n",
      "meaning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Who-e debel you?\"--he at last said--\"you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.\"\r\n",
      "And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the\r\n",
      "dark.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord, for God's sake, Peter Coffin!\" shouted I. \"Landlord! Watch!\r\n",
      "Coffin! Angels! save me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!\" again growled the\r\n",
      "cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the\r\n",
      "hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.\r\n",
      "But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light\r\n",
      "in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid now,\" said he, grinning again, \"Queequeg here wouldn't\r\n",
      "harm a hair of your head.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stop your grinning,\" shouted I, \"and why didn't you tell me that that\r\n",
      "infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought ye know'd it;--didn't I tell ye, he was a peddlin' heads\r\n",
      "around town?--but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look\r\n",
      "here--you sabbee me, I sabbee--you this man sleepe you--you sabbee?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Me sabbee plenty\"--grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and\r\n",
      "sitting up in bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You gettee in,\" he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and\r\n",
      "throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a civil\r\n",
      "but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a moment.\r\n",
      "For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking\r\n",
      "cannibal. What's all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to\r\n",
      "myself--the man's a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason\r\n",
      "to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober\r\n",
      "cannibal than a drunken Christian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Landlord,\" said I, \"tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or\r\n",
      "whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will\r\n",
      "turn in with him. But I don't fancy having a man smoking in bed with me.\r\n",
      "It's dangerous. Besides, I ain't insured.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely\r\n",
      "motioned me to get into bed--rolling over to one side as much as to\r\n",
      "say--\"I won't touch a leg of ye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good night, landlord,\" said I, \"you may go.\"\r\n",

      "CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg's arm thrown\r\n",
      "over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost\r\n",
      "thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of\r\n",
      "odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his\r\n",
      "tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure,\r\n",
      "no two parts of which were of one precise shade--owing I suppose to\r\n",
      "his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt\r\n",
      "sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times--this same arm of his, I\r\n",
      "say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt.\r\n",
      "Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I could\r\n",
      "hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues together; and\r\n",
      "it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I could tell that\r\n",
      "Queequeg was hugging me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a\r\n",
      "child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;\r\n",
      "whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle.\r\n",
      "The circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other--I\r\n",
      "think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little\r\n",
      "sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,\r\n",
      "was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,--my\r\n",
      "mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to\r\n",
      "bed, though it was only two o'clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,\r\n",
      "the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But\r\n",
      "there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the\r\n",
      "third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,\r\n",
      "and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse\r\n",
      "before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the\r\n",
      "small of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the\r\n",
      "sun shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the\r\n",
      "streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse\r\n",
      "and worse--at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my\r\n",
      "stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself\r\n",
      "at her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good\r\n",
      "slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie\r\n",
      "abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most\r\n",
      "conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For\r\n",
      "several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I\r\n",
      "have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes. At\r\n",
      "last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and slowly\r\n",
      "waking from it--half steeped in dreams--I opened my eyes, and the before\r\n",
      "sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt a shock\r\n",
      "running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was\r\n",
      "to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung\r\n",
      "over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form\r\n",
      "or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely seated by my\r\n",
      "bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there, frozen with\r\n",
      "the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet ever thinking\r\n",
      "that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid spell would be\r\n",
      "broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me;\r\n",
      "but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it all, and for\r\n",
      "days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in confounding\r\n",
      "attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I often puzzle\r\n",
      "myself with it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the\r\n",
      "supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to\r\n",
      "those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg's pagan\r\n",
      "arm thrown round me. But at length all the past night's events soberly\r\n",
      "recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to\r\n",
      "the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm--unlock his\r\n",
      "bridegroom clasp--yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,\r\n",
      "as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse\r\n",
      "him--\"Queequeg!\"--but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over,\r\n",
      "my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a\r\n",
      "slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk\r\n",
      "sleeping by the savage's side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A\r\n",
      "pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the\r\n",
      "broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! \"Queequeg!--in the name of\r\n",
      "goodness, Queequeg, wake!\" At length, by dint of much wriggling, and\r\n",
      "loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\r\n",
      "hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\r\n",
      "extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself\r\n",
      "all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed,\r\n",
      "stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he\r\n",
      "did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim\r\n",
      "consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over\r\n",
      "him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings\r\n",
      "now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at\r\n",
      "last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,\r\n",
      "and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon\r\n",
      "the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,\r\n",
      "if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress\r\n",
      "afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,\r\n",
      "under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the\r\n",
      "truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what\r\n",
      "you will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this\r\n",
      "particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much\r\n",
      "civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;\r\n",
      "staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for\r\n",
      "the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,\r\n",
      "a man like Queequeg you don't see every day, he and his ways were well\r\n",
      "worth unusual regarding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall one,\r\n",
      "by the by, and then--still minus his trowsers--he hunted up his boots.\r\n",
      "What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his next\r\n",
      "movement was to crush himself--boots in hand, and hat on--under the bed;\r\n",
      "when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he was\r\n",
      "hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I ever\r\n",
      "heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his\r\n",
      "boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition\r\n",
      "stage--neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized\r\n",
      "to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His\r\n",
      "education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not\r\n",
      "been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled\r\n",
      "himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,\r\n",
      "he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At\r\n",
      "last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his\r\n",
      "eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not\r\n",
      "being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide\r\n",
      "ones--probably not made to order either--rather pinched and tormented\r\n",
      "him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.\r\n",

      "pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,\r\n",
      "these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not\r\n",

      "was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating\r\n",
      "against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy\r\n",
      "breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there\r\n",
      "floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel's\r\n",
      "face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the\r\n",
      "ship's tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into\r\n",
      "the Victory's plank where Nelson fell. \"Ah, noble ship,\" the angel\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that\r\n",
      "had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in\r\n",
      "the likeness of a ship's bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "some thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and\r\n",

      "off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when\r\n",
      "she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a low\r\n",
      "tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the\r\n",
      "water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its\r\n",
      "prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the\r\n",
      "ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with\r\n",
      "one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up\r\n",
      "the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the deck, grappled\r\n",
      "a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a\r\n",
      "cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and\r\n",
      "Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his wild\r\n",
      "desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and told\r\n",
      "him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage--this sea\r\n",
      "Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain's cabin. They put him down among\r\n",
      "the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter content to\r\n",
      "toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained no seeming\r\n",
      "ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his\r\n",
      "untutored countrymen. For at bottom--so he told me--he was actuated by a\r\n",
      "profound desire to learn among the Christians, the arts whereby to\r\n",
      "make his people still happier than they were; and more than that,\r\n",
      "still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of whalemen soon\r\n",
      "convinced him that even Christians could be both miserable and wicked;\r\n",
      "infinitely more so, than all his father's heathens. Arrived at last in\r\n",
      "old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the sailors did there; and then going on\r\n",
      "to Nantucket, and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also,\r\n",
      "poor Queequeg gave it up for lost. Thought he, it's a wicked world in\r\n",
      "all meridians; I'll die a pagan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,\r\n",
      "wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer\r\n",
      "ways about him, though now some time from home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having\r\n",
      "a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he\r\n",
      "being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not yet;\r\n",
      "and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians, had\r\n",
      "unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan\r\n",
      "Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,--as soon as\r\n",
      "he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he proposed to\r\n",
      "sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They had made a\r\n",
      "harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future\r\n",
      "movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon\r\n",
      "this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my\r\n",
      "intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port for\r\n",
      "an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to accompany\r\n",
      "me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the same watch,\r\n",
      "the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my every hap;\r\n",
      "with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of both worlds.\r\n",
      "To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection I now felt\r\n",
      "for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such, could not\r\n",
      "fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was wholly ignorant\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "so much--for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their\r\n",
      "streets,--but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we\r\n",
      "heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg\r\n",
      "now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I asked\r\n",
      "him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and\r\n",
      "whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in\r\n",
      "substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet\r\n",
      "he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of\r\n",
      "assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate\r\n",
      "with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers\r\n",
      "and mowers, who go into the farmers' meadows armed with their own\r\n",
      "scythes--though in no wise obliged to furnish them--even so, Queequeg,\r\n",
      "for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about\r\n",
      "the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The owners\r\n",
      "of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his\r\n",
      "heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the\r\n",
      "thing--though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of\r\n",
      "Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water\r\n",
      "of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and\r\n",
      "this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided\r\n",
      "mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once\r\n",
      "touched at Rokovoko, and its commander--from all accounts, a very\r\n",
      "stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain--this\r\n",
      "commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg's sister, a\r\n",
      "pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding\r\n",
      "guests were assembled at the bride's bamboo cottage, this Captain\r\n",
      "marches in, and being assigned the post of honour, placed himself over\r\n",
      "against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the\r\n",
      "King, Queequeg's father. Grace being said,--for those people have their\r\n",
      "grace as well as we--though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such\r\n",
      "times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying the\r\n",
      "ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts--Grace, I say,\r\n",
      "being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony\r\n",
      "of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers\r\n",
      "into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates. Seeing himself\r\n",
      "placed next the Priest, and noting the ceremony, and thinking\r\n",
      "himself--being Captain of a ship--as having plain precedence over a\r\n",
      "mere island King, especially in the King's own house--the Captain coolly\r\n",
      "proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowl;--taking it I suppose for a\r\n",

      "On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to the\r\n",

      "this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging bowsprit, that\r\n",
      "for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers, a\r\n",

      "companionable; as though a white man were anything more dignified than a\r\n",
      "whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies and bumpkins there, who,\r\n",
      "by their intense greenness, must have come from the heart and centre of\r\n",
      "all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him\r\n",
      "behind his back. I thought the bumpkin's hour of doom was come. Dropping\r\n",
      "his harpoon, the brawny savage caught him in his arms, and by an almost\r\n",
      "miraculous dexterity and strength, sent him high up bodily into the air;\r\n",
      "then slightly tapping his stern in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with\r\n",

      "lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Capting! Capting!\" yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;\r\n",
      "\"Capting, Capting, here's the devil.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hallo, _you_ sir,\" cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking\r\n",
      "up to Queequeg, \"what in thunder do you mean by that? Don't you know you\r\n",
      "might have killed that chap?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What him say?\" said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He say,\" said I, \"that you came near kill-e that man there,\" pointing\r\n",
      "to the still shivering greenhorn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Kill-e,\" cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly\r\n",
      "expression of disdain, \"ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e\r\n",
      "so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look you,\" roared the Captain, \"I'll kill-e YOU, you cannibal, if you\r\n",
      "try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to\r\n",
      "mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted\r\n",
      "the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to\r\n",
      "side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor\r\n",
      "fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all\r\n",
      "hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,\r\n",
      "seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost\r\n",
      "in one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of\r\n",
      "snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of\r\n",
      "being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the\r\n",
      "boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the\r\n",
      "midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and\r\n",
      "crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one\r\n",
      "end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it\r\n",
      "round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar\r\n",
      "was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the\r\n",
      "wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg,\r\n",
      "stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of\r\n",
      "a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog,\r\n",
      "throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by turns revealing\r\n",
      "his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I looked at the grand\r\n",
      "and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved. The greenhorn had gone\r\n",
      "down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the water, Queequeg, now\r\n",
      "took an instant's glance around him, and seeming to see just how matters\r\n",
      "were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes more, and he rose again,\r\n",
      "one arm still striking out, and with the other dragging a lifeless form.\r\n",
      "The boat soon picked them up. The poor bumpkin was restored. All hands\r\n",
      "voted Queequeg a noble trump; the captain begged his pardon. From that\r\n",
      "hour I clove to Queequeg like a barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took\r\n",
      "his last long dive.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he at\r\n",
      "all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He only\r\n",
      "asked for water--fresh water--something to wipe the brine off; that\r\n",
      "done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the\r\n",
      "bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying\r\n",
      "to himself--\"It's a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We\r\n",

      "swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant\r\n",
      "Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child borne\r\n",
      "out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the same\r\n",
      "direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage they\r\n",
      "discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory casket,--the\r\n",
      "poor little Indian's skeleton.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should take\r\n",
      "to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs in\r\n",
      "the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more\r\n",
      "experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,\r\n",
      "launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;\r\n",
      "put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in\r\n",
      "at Behring's Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared\r\n",
      "everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the\r\n",
      "flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea\r\n",
      "Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that\r\n",
      "his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and\r\n",
      "malicious assaults!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific, and\r\n",

      "the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the\r\n",
      "Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept\r\n",
      "hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin\r\n",
      "Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he\r\n",
      "plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck at\r\n",
      "the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow\r\n",
      "warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the\r\n",
      "larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a\r\n",
      "corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first\r\n",
      "man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very\r\n",
      "much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg\r\n",
      "insisted that the yellow warehouse--our first point of departure--must\r\n",
      "be left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to\r\n",
      "say it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little\r\n",
      "in the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant\r\n",
      "to inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no\r\n",
      "mistaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses' ears,\r\n",
      "swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an\r\n",
      "old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other\r\n",
      "side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.\r\n",
      "Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I\r\n",
      "could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort of\r\n",
      "crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes, TWO\r\n",
      "of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It's ominous, thinks I. A\r\n",
      "Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port; tombstones\r\n",
      "staring at me in the whalemen's chapel; and here a gallows! and a pair\r\n",
      "of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out oblique hints\r\n",
      "touching Tophet?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman\r\n",
      "with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,\r\n",
      "under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured\r\n",
      "eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen\r\n",
      "shirt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Get along with ye,\" said she to the man, \"or I'll be combing ye!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come on, Queequeg,\" said I, \"all right. There's Mrs. Hussey.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving\r\n",
      "Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon\r\n",
      "making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey, postponing\r\n",
      "further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little room, and\r\n",
      "seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded\r\n",
      "repast, turned round to us and said--\"Clam or Cod?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's that about Cods, ma'am?\" said I, with much politeness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Clam or Cod?\" she repeated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A clam for supper? a cold clam; is THAT what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?\"\r\n",
      "says I, \"but that's a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter\r\n",

      "But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple\r\n",
      "Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing\r\n",
      "but the word \"clam,\" Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading to\r\n",
      "the kitchen, and bawling out \"clam for two,\" disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Queequeg,\" said I, \"do you think that we can make out a supper for us\r\n",
      "both on one clam?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the\r\n",
      "apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder\r\n",
      "came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!\r\n",
      "hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than\r\n",
      "hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up into\r\n",
      "little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully seasoned\r\n",
      "with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the frosty\r\n",
      "voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food\r\n",
      "before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we despatched\r\n",
      "it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and bethinking\r\n",
      "me of Mrs. Hussey's clam and cod announcement, I thought I would try\r\n",
      "a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered the word\r\n",
      "\"cod\" with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few moments the\r\n",
      "savoury steam came forth again, but with a different flavor, and in good\r\n",
      "time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I\r\n",
      "to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head?\r\n",
      "What's that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? \"But look,\r\n",
      "Queequeg, ain't that a live eel in your bowl? Where's your harpoon?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved\r\n",
      "its name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for\r\n",
      "breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you\r\n",
      "began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area\r\n",
      "before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a polished\r\n",
      "necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account books\r\n",
      "bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the milk,\r\n",
      "too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning happening\r\n",
      "to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen's boats, I saw\r\n",
      "Hosea's brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and marching along the\r\n",
      "sand with each foot in a cod's decapitated head, looking very slip-shod,\r\n",
      "I assure ye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey\r\n",
      "concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to precede\r\n",
      "me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded his\r\n",
      "harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. \"Why not?\" said I;\r\n",
      "\"every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon--but why not?\" \"Because\r\n",
      "it's dangerous,\" says she. \"Ever since young Stiggs coming from that\r\n",
      "unfort'nt v'y'ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with\r\n",
      "only three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back, with\r\n",
      "his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to take\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and\r\n",
      "no small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been\r\n",
      "diligently consulting Yojo--the name of his black little god--and Yojo\r\n",
      "had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it\r\n",
      "everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in\r\n",
      "harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say, Yojo\r\n",
      "earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly\r\n",
      "with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order to\r\n",
      "do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself, I,\r\n",
      "Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though it\r\n",
      "had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship\r\n",
      "myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great\r\n",
      "confidence in the excellence of Yojo's judgment and surprising forecast\r\n",
      "of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather good\r\n",
      "sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in all\r\n",
      "cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, this plan of Queequeg's, or rather Yojo's, touching the selection\r\n",
      "of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little relied\r\n",
      "upon Queequeg's sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry\r\n",
      "us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances produced\r\n",
      "no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and accordingly\r\n",
      "prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort\r\n",
      "of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that trifling little\r\n",
      "affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up with Yojo in our\r\n",
      "little bedroom--for it seemed that it was some sort of Lent or Ramadan,\r\n",
      "or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with Queequeg and Yojo that\r\n",
      "day; HOW it was I never could find out, for, though I applied myself\r\n",
      "to it several times, I never could master his liturgies and XXXIX\r\n",
      "Articles--leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his tomahawk pipe, and Yojo\r\n",
      "warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings, I sallied out among\r\n",
      "the shipping. After much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries,\r\n",
      "I learnt that there were three ships up for three-years' voyages--The\r\n",
      "Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the Pequod. DEVIL-DAM, I do not know the\r\n",
      "origin of; TIT-BIT is obvious; PEQUOD, you will no doubt remember, was\r\n",
      "the name of a celebrated tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct\r\n",
      "as the ancient Medes. I peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her,\r\n",
      "hopped over to the Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod,\r\n",
      "looked around her for a moment, and then decided that this was the very\r\n",
      "ship for us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I\r\n",
      "know;--square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box\r\n",
      "galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a\r\n",
      "rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old\r\n",
      "school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look\r\n",
      "about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms\r\n",
      "of all four oceans, her old hull's complexion was darkened like a French\r\n",
      "grenadier's, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her venerable\r\n",
      "bows looked bearded. Her masts--cut somewhere on the coast of Japan,\r\n",
      "where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale--her masts stood\r\n",
      "stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her\r\n",
      "ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped\r\n",
      "flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these\r\n",
      "her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining\r\n",
      "to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed.\r\n",
      "Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he commanded\r\n",
      "another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one of the\r\n",
      "principal owners of the Pequod,--this old Peleg, during the term of his\r\n",
      "chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and inlaid\r\n",
      "it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device, unmatched\r\n",
      "by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake's carved buckler or bedstead. She\r\n",
      "was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his neck heavy with\r\n",
      "pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of trophies. A cannibal of\r\n",
      "a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies. All\r\n",
      "round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous\r\n",
      "jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale, inserted there for\r\n",
      "pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to. Those thews ran not\r\n",
      "through base blocks of land wood, but deftly travelled over sheaves of\r\n",
      "sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm, she sported\r\n",
      "there a tiller; and that tiller was in one mass, curiously carved\r\n",
      "from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe. The helmsman who\r\n",
      "steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the Tartar, when he holds\r\n",
      "back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a\r\n",
      "most melancholy! All noble things are touched with that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having authority,\r\n",
      "in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at first I saw\r\n",
      "nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of tent, or\r\n",
      "rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It seemed only\r\n",
      "a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical shape, some ten\r\n",
      "feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber black bone taken\r\n",
      "from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right-whale.\r\n",
      "Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of these slabs laced\r\n",
      "together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at the apex united in\r\n",
      "a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the\r\n",
      "top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem's head. A triangular opening\r\n",
      "faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the insider commanded a\r\n",
      "complete view forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who\r\n",
      "by his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and\r\n",
      "the ship's work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of\r\n",
      "command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all\r\n",
      "over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a\r\n",
      "stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was\r\n",
      "constructed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of\r\n",
      "the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,\r\n",
      "and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;\r\n",
      "only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest\r\n",
      "wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from\r\n",
      "his continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to\r\n",
      "windward;--for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed\r\n",
      "together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.\r\n",

      "\"Is this the Captain of the Pequod?\" said I, advancing to the door of\r\n",

      "step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back\r\n",
      "to me and tell me what ye see there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not\r\n",
      "knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But\r\n",
      "concentrating all his crow's feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started\r\n",
      "me on the errand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the\r\n",
      "ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely\r\n",
      "pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but\r\n",
      "exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I\r\n",
      "could see.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what's the report?\" said Peleg when I came back; \"what did ye\r\n",
      "see?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not much,\" I replied--\"nothing but water; considerable horizon though,\r\n",
      "and there's a squall coming up, I think.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go\r\n",
      "round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can't ye see the world where\r\n",
      "you stand?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the\r\n",
      "Pequod was as good a ship as any--I thought the best--and all this I now\r\n",
      "repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his willingness\r\n",
      "to ship me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,\" he added--\"come\r\n",
      "along with ye.\" And so saying, he led the way below deck into the cabin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and\r\n",
      "surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with\r\n",
      "Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other\r\n",
      "shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd\r\n",
      "of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards; each\r\n",
      "owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a nail\r\n",
      "or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in whaling\r\n",
      "vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks\r\n",
      "bringing in good interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a\r\n",
      "Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to\r\n",
      "this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the\r\n",
      "peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified\r\n",
      "by things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same\r\n",
      "Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They\r\n",
      "are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with Scripture\r\n",
      "names--a singularly common fashion on the island--and in childhood\r\n",
      "naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the Quaker\r\n",
      "idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless adventure\r\n",
      "of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these unoutgrown\r\n",
      "peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not unworthy a\r\n",
      "Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when these things\r\n",
      "unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a globular brain\r\n",
      "and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and seclusion\r\n",
      "of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and beneath\r\n",
      "constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think\r\n",
      "untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature's sweet or\r\n",
      "savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding\r\n",
      "breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental\r\n",
      "advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language--that man makes\r\n",
      "one in a whole nation's census--a mighty pageant creature, formed for\r\n",
      "noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically\r\n",
      "regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems\r\n",
      "a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For all\r\n",
      "men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be sure\r\n",
      "of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease. But,\r\n",
      "as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another; and\r\n",
      "still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from another\r\n",
      "phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.\r\n",
      "But unlike Captain Peleg--who cared not a rush for what are called\r\n",
      "serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the\r\n",
      "veriest of all trifles--Captain Bildad had not only been originally\r\n",
      "educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but all\r\n",
      "his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely island\r\n",
      "creatures, round the Horn--all that had not moved this native born\r\n",
      "Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his\r\n",
      "vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of\r\n",
      "common consistency about worthy Captain Peleg. Though refusing, from\r\n",
      "conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself\r\n",
      "had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn foe\r\n",
      "to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled tuns\r\n",
      "upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening of his\r\n",
      "days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence, I do\r\n",
      "not know; but it did not seem to concern him much, and very probably\r\n",
      "he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a man's\r\n",
      "religion is one thing, and this practical world quite another. This\r\n",
      "world pays dividends. Rising from a little cabin-boy in short clothes\r\n",
      "of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a broad shad-bellied waistcoat;\r\n",
      "from that becoming boat-header, chief-mate, and captain, and finally a\r\n",
      "ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted before, had concluded his adventurous\r\n",
      "career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of\r\n",
      "sixty, and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his\r\n",
      "well-earned income.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an\r\n",
      "incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard\r\n",
      "task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a\r\n",
      "curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,\r\n",
      "upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital, sore\r\n",
      "exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker, he was\r\n",
      "certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used to swear,\r\n",
      "though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an inordinate\r\n",
      "quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When Bildad was a\r\n",
      "chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking at you, made\r\n",
      "you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch something--a hammer\r\n",
      "or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at something or other,\r\n",
      "never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished before him. His own\r\n",
      "person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character. On his\r\n",
      "long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no superfluous beard,\r\n",
      "his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like the worn nap of his\r\n",
      "broad-brimmed hat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I\r\n",
      "followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks\r\n",
      "was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,\r\n",
      "and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was\r\n",
      "placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was\r\n",
      "buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in\r\n",
      "reading from a ponderous volume.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bildad,\" cried Captain Peleg, \"at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been\r\n",
      "studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my certain\r\n",
      "knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,\r\n",
      "Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up, and\r\n",
      "seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He says he's our man, Bildad,\" said Peleg, \"he wants to ship.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dost thee?\" said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I dost,\" said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do ye think of him, Bildad?\" said Peleg.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He'll do,\" said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at\r\n",
      "his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,\r\n",
      "his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said\r\n",
      "nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,\r\n",
      "and drawing forth the ship's articles, placed pen and ink before him,\r\n",
      "and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time\r\n",
      "to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for the\r\n",
      "voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no\r\n",
      "wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares of\r\n",
      "the profits called lays, and that these lays were proportioned to the\r\n",
      "degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ship's\r\n",
      "company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own\r\n",
      "lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the sea,\r\n",
      "could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that\r\n",
      "from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th lay--that\r\n",
      "is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever\r\n",
      "that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they\r\n",
      "call a rather LONG LAY, yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a\r\n",
      "lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out\r\n",
      "on it, not to speak of my three years' beef and board, for which I would\r\n",
      "not have to pay one stiver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely\r\n",
      "fortune--and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those\r\n",
      "that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the\r\n",
      "world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this grim\r\n",
      "sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the 275th lay\r\n",
      "would be about the fair thing, but would not have been surprised had I\r\n",
      "been offered the 200th, considering I was of a broad-shouldered make.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about\r\n",
      "receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard\r\n",
      "something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;\r\n",
      "how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore\r\n",
      "the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the\r\n",
      "whole management of the ship's affairs to these two. And I did not know\r\n",
      "but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about\r\n",
      "shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,\r\n",
      "quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his\r\n",
      "own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his\r\n",
      "jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he was\r\n",
      "such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded\r\n",
      "us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, \"LAY not up for\r\n",
      "yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth--\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, Captain Bildad,\" interrupted Peleg, \"what d'ye say, what lay\r\n",
      "shall we give this young man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thou knowest best,\" was the sepulchral reply, \"the seven hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-seventh wouldn't be too much, would it?--'where moth and rust do\r\n",
      "corrupt, but LAY--'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "LAY, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,\r\n",
      "shall not LAY up many LAYS here below, where moth and rust do corrupt.\r\n",
      "It was an exceedingly LONG LAY that, indeed; and though from the\r\n",
      "magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet\r\n",
      "the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make\r\n",
      "a TEENTH of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven\r\n",
      "hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,\" cried Peleg, \"thou dost not want to\r\n",
      "swindle this young man! he must have more than that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,\" again said Bildad, without lifting\r\n",
      "his eyes; and then went on mumbling--\"for where your treasure is, there\r\n",
      "will your heart be also.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,\" said Peleg, \"do ye\r\n",
      "hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,\r\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the\r\n",
      "duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship--widows and orphans,\r\n",
      "many of them--and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this\r\n",
      "young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those\r\n",
      "orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thou Bildad!\" roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the\r\n",
      "cabin. \"Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these\r\n",
      "matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be\r\n",
      "heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape\r\n",
      "Horn.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said Bildad steadily, \"thy conscience may be drawing\r\n",
      "ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can't tell; but as thou art still\r\n",
      "an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy conscience be\r\n",
      "but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the\r\n",
      "fiery pit, Captain Peleg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye\r\n",
      "insult me. It's an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that\r\n",
      "he's bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me, and\r\n",
      "start my soul-bolts, but I'll--I'll--yes, I'll swallow a live goat with\r\n",
      "all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting, drab-coloured\r\n",
      "son of a wooden gun--a straight wake with ye!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a marvellous\r\n",
      "oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and\r\n",
      "responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up\r\n",
      "all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily\r\n",
      "commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,\r\n",
      "I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened\r\n",
      "wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the\r\n",
      "transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of\r\n",
      "withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As\r\n",
      "for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more\r\n",
      "left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a\r\n",
      "little as if still nervously agitated. \"Whew!\" he whistled at last--\"the\r\n",
      "squall's gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at\r\n",
      "sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs\r\n",
      "the grindstone. That's he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,\r\n",
      "Ishmael's thy name, didn't ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,\r\n",
      "for the three hundredth lay.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Captain Peleg,\" said I, \"I have a friend with me who wants to ship\r\n",
      "too--shall I bring him down to-morrow?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To be sure,\" said Peleg. \"Fetch him along, and we'll look at him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What lay does he want?\" groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in\r\n",
      "which he had again been burying himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,\" said Peleg. \"Has he ever\r\n",
      "whaled it any?\" turning to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, bring him along then.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I\r\n",
      "had done a good morning's work, and that the Pequod was the identical\r\n",
      "ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the Captain\r\n",
      "with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though, indeed, in\r\n",
      "many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and receive all\r\n",
      "her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving\r\n",
      "to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged, and the\r\n",
      "shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the captain have\r\n",
      "a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he does not trouble\r\n",
      "himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to the owners till\r\n",
      "all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to have a look at\r\n",
      "him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands. Turning back\r\n",
      "I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain Ahab was to be found.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It's all right enough; thou\r\n",
      "art shipped.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but I should like to see him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But I don't think thou wilt be able to at present. I don't know exactly\r\n",
      "what's the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the house; a sort\r\n",
      "of sick, and yet he don't look so. In fact, he ain't sick; but no, he\r\n",
      "isn't well either. Any how, young man, he won't always see me, so I\r\n",
      "don't suppose he will thee. He's a queer man, Captain Ahab--so some\r\n",
      "think--but a good one. Oh, thou'lt like him well enough; no fear, no\r\n",
      "fear. He's a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab; doesn't speak\r\n",
      "much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen. Mark ye, be\r\n",
      "forewarned; Ahab's above the common; Ahab's been in colleges, as well as\r\n",
      "'mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders than the waves; fixed\r\n",
      "his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than whales. His lance!\r\n",
      "aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle! Oh! he ain't\r\n",

      "like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost\r\n",
      "intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;\r\n",
      "especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of\r\n",
      "eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon\r\n",
      "Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could\r\n",
      "do--for all my polite arts and blandishments--he would not move a peg,\r\n",
      "nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in\r\n",
      "the slightest way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do\r\n",
      "they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;\r\n",
      "yes, it's part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he'll\r\n",
      "get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can't last for ever, thank God,\r\n",
      "and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don't believe it's very\r\n",
      "punctual then.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long\r\n",
      "stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage, as\r\n",
      "they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or brig,\r\n",
      "confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only); after\r\n",
      "listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o'clock, I went\r\n",
      "up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg must\r\n",
      "certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there he\r\n",
      "was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began to\r\n",
      "grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be\r\n",
      "sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,\r\n",
      "holding a piece of wood on his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and have\r\n",
      "some supper. You'll starve; you'll kill yourself, Queequeg.\" But not a\r\n",
      "word did he reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;\r\n",
      "and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to\r\n",
      "turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as\r\n",
      "it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his ordinary\r\n",
      "round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not get into\r\n",
      "the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere thought\r\n",
      "of Queequeg--not four feet off--sitting there in that uneasy position,\r\n",
      "stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really wretched. Think of\r\n",
      "it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his\r\n",
      "hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of\r\n",
      "day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he\r\n",
      "had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of\r\n",
      "sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints,\r\n",
      "but with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his\r\n",
      "forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person's religion,\r\n",
      "be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any\r\n",
      "other person, because that other person don't believe it also. But when\r\n",
      "a man's religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment\r\n",
      "to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to\r\n",
      "lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and\r\n",
      "argue the point with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And just so I now did with Queequeg. \"Queequeg,\" said I, \"get into bed\r\n",
      "now, and lie and listen to me.\" I then went on, beginning with the rise\r\n",
      "and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various\r\n",
      "religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show\r\n",
      "Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings in\r\n",
      "cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health; useless\r\n",
      "for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene and\r\n",
      "common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such an\r\n",
      "extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly pained\r\n",
      "me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous Ramadan\r\n",
      "of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in; hence the\r\n",
      "spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be\r\n",
      "half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish\r\n",
      "such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In one word, Queequeg,\r\n",
      "said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first born on an undigested\r\n",
      "apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated through the hereditary\r\n",
      "dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with\r\n",
      "dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it\r\n",
      "in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great\r\n",
      "feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle\r\n",
      "wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o'clock in the\r\n",
      "afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No more, Queequeg,\" said I, shuddering; \"that will do;\" for I knew the\r\n",
      "inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who had\r\n",
      "visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom, when\r\n",
      "a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in the\r\n",
      "yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were placed\r\n",
      "in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau, with\r\n",
      "breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths, were\r\n",
      "sent round with the victor's compliments to all his friends, just as\r\n",
      "though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much\r\n",
      "impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow seemed\r\n",
      "dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered from his\r\n",
      "own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more than one\r\n",
      "third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and, finally, he\r\n",
      "no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than\r\n",
      "I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and\r\n",
      "compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible\r\n",
      "young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty\r\n",
      "breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not\r\n",
      "make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the\r\n",

      "he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they would\r\n",
      "answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected aboard\r\n",
      "every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could attend\r\n",
      "to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I had been\r\n",
      "downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly in my heart\r\n",
      "that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage,\r\n",
      "without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute\r\n",
      "dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea.\r\n",
      "But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he be\r\n",
      "already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up his\r\n",
      "suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I said\r\n",
      "nothing, and tried to think nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would\r\n",

      "all in the family too;--sharp frost this morning, ain't it? Good-bye to\r\n",
      "ye. Shan't see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it's before the Grand\r\n",

      "quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the\r\n",
      "hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward\r\n",
      "to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a\r\n",
      "light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a\r\n",
      "tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his\r\n",
      "face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber\r\n",
      "slept upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?\" said I,\r\n",
      "looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the wharf,\r\n",
      "Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I would\r\n",
      "have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter,\r\n",
      "were it not for Elijah's otherwise inexplicable question. But I beat the\r\n",
      "thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to Queequeg\r\n",
      "that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to establish\r\n",
      "himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper's rear, as though\r\n",
      "feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado, sat quietly\r\n",
      "down there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Gracious! Queequeg, don't sit there,\" said I.\r\n",

      "he'll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don't wake.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and\r\n",
      "lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing\r\n",
      "over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning him\r\n",
      "in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his\r\n",
      "land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,\r\n",
      "chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening some\r\n",
      "of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house comfortably in\r\n",
      "that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows, and lay\r\n",
      "them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was very convenient on\r\n",
      "an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs which are convertible\r\n",
      "into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief calling his attendant, and\r\n",
      "desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree, perhaps\r\n",
      "in some damp marshy place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk\r\n",
      "from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper's head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's that for, Queequeg?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,\r\n",
      "which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed\r\n",
      "his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The\r\n",
      "strong vapour now completely filling the contracted hole, it began\r\n",
      "to tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed\r\n",
      "troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and\r\n",
      "rubbed his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Holloa!\" he breathed at last, \"who be ye smokers?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Shipped men,\" answered I, \"when does she sail?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain\r\n",

      "I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we\r\n",
      "heard a noise on deck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Holloa! Starbuck's astir,\" said the rigger. \"He's a lively chief mate,\r\n",
      "that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.\" And so\r\n",
      "saying he went on deck, and we followed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and\r\n",
      "threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively\r\n",
      "engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain\r\n",
      "Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the\r\n",
      "quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as\r\n",
      "well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign of\r\n",
      "him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But then,\r\n",
      "the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the\r\n",
      "ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed, as that was\r\n",
      "not at all his proper business, but the pilot's; and as he was not\r\n",
      "yet completely recovered--so they said--therefore, Captain Ahab stayed\r\n",
      "below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the merchant\r\n",
      "service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable\r\n",
      "time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the cabin table,\r\n",
      "having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends, before they\r\n",
      "quit the ship for good with the pilot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain\r\n",
      "Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and\r\n",
      "commanding, and not Bildad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,\" he cried, as the sailors lingered at\r\n",
      "the main-mast. \"Mr. Starbuck, drive'em aft.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Strike the tent there!\"--was the next order. As I hinted before, this\r\n",
      "whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the\r\n",
      "Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known to\r\n",
      "be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!--jump!\"--was the next command, and\r\n",
      "the crew sprang for the handspikes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot\r\n",
      "is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be it\r\n",
      "known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed pilots\r\n",
      "of the port--he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in\r\n",
      "order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was concerned\r\n",
      "in, for he never piloted any other craft--Bildad, I say, might now\r\n",
      "be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching\r\n",
      "anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody,\r\n",
      "to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some sort of\r\n",
      "a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good will.\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that no\r\n",
      "profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in\r\n",
      "getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice\r\n",
      "copy of Watts in each seaman's berth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped\r\n",
      "and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he would\r\n",
      "sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I paused\r\n",
      "on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of the\r\n",
      "perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a\r\n",
      "pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in pious\r\n",
      "Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred and\r\n",
      "seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear, and\r\n",
      "turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in the\r\n",
      "act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my first\r\n",
      "kick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?\" he roared.\r\n",
      "\"Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don't ye\r\n",
      "spring, I say, all of ye--spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red\r\n",
      "whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I\r\n",
      "say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!\" And so saying, he moved\r\n",
      "along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while\r\n",
      "imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,\r\n",
      "Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It\r\n",
      "was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into\r\n",
      "night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose\r\n",
      "freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of\r\n",
      "teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white\r\n",
      "ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from\r\n",
      "the bows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as the\r\n",
      "old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering frost\r\n",
      "all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his steady\r\n",
      "notes were heard,--\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living green.\r\n",
      "So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.\"\r\n",

      "boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there was\r\n",
      "yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and meads\r\n",
      "and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the spring,\r\n",
      "untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed\r\n",
      "no longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging\r\n",
      "alongside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected at\r\n",
      "this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;\r\n",
      "very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a\r\n",
      "voyage--beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of\r\n",
      "his hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate\r\n",
      "sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to\r\n",
      "encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to\r\n",
      "a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,--poor old Bildad\r\n",
      "lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the\r\n",
      "cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and\r\n",
      "looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only\r\n",
      "bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards\r\n",
      "the land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere\r\n",
      "and nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,\r\n",
      "convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,\r\n",
      "for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,\r\n",
      "\"Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all\r\n",
      "his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern\r\n",
      "came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck--now\r\n",
      "a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look\r\n",
      "about him,--\"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the\r\n",
      "main-yard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now!\r\n",
      "Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy--say your last. Luck to ye,\r\n",
      "Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb--luck to ye, Mr. Flask--good-bye and\r\n",
      "good luck to ye all--and this day three years I'll have a hot supper\r\n",
      "smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,\" murmured old\r\n",
      "Bildad, almost incoherently. \"I hope ye'll have fine weather now, so\r\n",
      "that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye--a pleasant sun is all\r\n",
      "he needs, and ye'll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go.\r\n",
      "Be careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don't stave the boats needlessly,\r\n",

      "the green locker! Don't whale it too much a' Lord's days, men; but don't\r\n",

      "Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,\r\n",

      "neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an\r\n",
      "indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the\r\n",
      "chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged\r\n",
      "for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his\r\n",
      "whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his\r\n",
      "crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable\r\n",
      "arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about the\r\n",
      "snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very death-lock of\r\n",
      "the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off-handedly, as\r\n",
      "a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his old rigadig tunes\r\n",
      "while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster. Long usage had,\r\n",

      "thought of death itself, there is no telling. Whether he ever thought of\r\n",
      "it at all, might be a question; but, if he ever did chance to cast his\r\n",
      "mind that way after a comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor,\r\n",
      "he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir\r\n",
      "themselves there, about something which he would find out when he obeyed\r\n",
      "the order, and not sooner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,\r\n",
      "unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a\r\n",
      "world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;\r\n",
      "what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that\r\n",
      "thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black\r\n",
      "little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would\r\n",
      "almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his\r\n",
      "nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready\r\n",
      "loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever he\r\n",
      "turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from\r\n",
      "the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in\r\n",
      "readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his\r\n",
      "legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his\r\n",
      "peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air, whether\r\n",
      "ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of\r\n",
      "the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in time of the\r\n",

      "The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha's Vineyard. A\r\n",
      "short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,\r\n",
      "who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally\r\n",
      "and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of\r\n",
      "honour with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost\r\n",

      "bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of\r\n",
      "any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,\r\n",
      "the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least\r\n",
      "water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small\r\n",
      "application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This\r\n",
      "ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in\r\n",
      "the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a\r\n",
      "three years' voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted\r\n",
      "that length of time. As a carpenter's nails are divided into wrought\r\n",
      "nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask\r\n",
      "was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They\r\n",
      "called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could\r\n",
      "be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in Arctic\r\n",
      "whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted\r\n",
      "into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Now these three mates--Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous\r\n",

      "Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales,\r\n",
      "these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being armed with\r\n",
      "their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio of lancers;\r\n",
      "even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,\r\n",
      "who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when\r\n",
      "the former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and\r\n",
      "moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy\r\n",
      "and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set\r\n",

      "eyes--for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but Antarctic in their\r\n",
      "glittering expression--all this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor\r\n",
      "of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters, who, in quest\r\n",
      "of the great New England moose, had scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal\r\n",
      "forests of the main. But no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild\r\n",

      "whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the\r\n",
      "infallible arrow of the sires. To look at the tawny brawn of his lithe\r\n",
      "snaky limbs, you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of\r\n",
      "the earlier Puritans, and half-believed this wild Indian to be a son\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black\r\n",

      "from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called\r\n",
      "them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to\r\n",
      "them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\r\n",
      "lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been\r\n",
      "anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors\r\n",
      "most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold\r\n",
      "life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what\r\n",

      "and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six\r\n",
      "feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at\r\n",
      "him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to\r\n",
      "beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus\r\n",

      "these cases the native American liberally provides the brains, the rest\r\n",
      "of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No small number of\r\n",

      "they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling, but\r\n",

      "about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such\r\n",
      "emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,\r\n",
      "were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the\r\n",
      "tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me\r\n",

      "fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation\r\n",
      "in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the aspect\r\n",
      "of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was most\r\n",
      "forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and induce\r\n",
      "confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage. Three\r\n",
      "better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own different way,\r\n",
      "could not readily be found, and they were every one of them Americans; a\r\n",

      "of those less lowering, but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the\r\n",
      "transition, when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water\r\n",
      "with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity, that as I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the\r\n",
      "recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when\r\n",
      "the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,\r\n",
      "or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His\r\n",
      "whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an\r\n",
      "unalterable mould, like Cellini's cast Perseus. Threading its way out\r\n",
      "from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his\r\n",
      "tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing,\r\n",
      "you saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that\r\n",
      "perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of\r\n",
      "a great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and\r\n",
      "without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from top\r\n",
      "to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still greenly\r\n",
      "alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or whether it\r\n",
      "was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could certainly say.\r\n",
      "By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or no allusion was\r\n",
      "made to it, especially by the mates. But once Tashtego's senior, an old\r\n",
      "Gay-Head Indian among the crew, superstitiously asserted that not till\r\n",
      "he was full forty years old did Ahab become that way branded, and\r\n",
      "then it came upon him, not in the fury of any mortal fray, but in\r\n",
      "an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this wild hint seemed inferentially\r\n",
      "negatived, by what a grey Manxman insinuated, an old sepulchral man,\r\n",
      "who, having never before sailed out of Nantucket, had never ere this\r\n",
      "laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless, the old sea-traditions, the\r\n",
      "immemorial credulities, popularly invested this old Manxman with\r\n",
      "preternatural powers of discernment. So that no white sailor seriously\r\n",
      "contradicted him when he said that if ever Captain Ahab should\r\n",
      "be tranquilly laid out--which might hardly come to pass, so he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the livid\r\n",
      "brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly noted\r\n",
      "that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric\r\n",
      "white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come to me that\r\n",
      "this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of\r\n",
      "the sperm whale's jaw. \"Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,\" said the old\r\n",
      "Gay-Head Indian once; \"but like his dismasted craft, he shipped another\r\n",
      "mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of 'em.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of\r\n",
      "the Pequod's quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds, there\r\n",
      "was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the plank.\r\n",
      "His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and holding by a\r\n",
      "shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out beyond the\r\n",
      "ship's ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest fortitude,\r\n",
      "a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and fearless,\r\n",
      "forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor did his\r\n",
      "officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest gestures\r\n",
      "and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not painful,\r\n",
      "consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not only that,\r\n",
      "but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his\r\n",
      "face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe.\r\n",

      "sailed through oceans; I have had to do with whales with these visible\r\n",
      "hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There are some preliminaries to\r\n",
      "settle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology\r\n",
      "is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it\r\n",
      "still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of\r\n",
      "Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnaeus declares, \"I hereby separate the whales from\r\n",
      "the fish.\" But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,\r\n",
      "sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnaeus's express edict,\r\n",
      "were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the\r\n",
      "Leviathan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grounds upon which Linnaeus would fain have banished the whales from\r\n",
      "the waters, he states as follows: \"On account of their warm bilocular\r\n",
      "heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem\r\n",
      "intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,\" and finally, \"ex lege naturae jure\r\n",
      "meritoque.\" I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley\r\n",
      "Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and\r\n",
      "they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether\r\n",
      "insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned\r\n",
      "ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.\r\n",
      "This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal\r\n",
      "respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnaeus has given\r\n",
      "you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;\r\n",
      "whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as\r\n",
      "conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a\r\n",
      "whale is A SPOUTING FISH WITH A HORIZONTAL TAIL. There you have\r\n",
      "him. However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded\r\n",
      "meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a\r\n",
      "fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is\r\n",
      "still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have\r\n",
      "noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a\r\n",
      "vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,\r\n",
      "though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal\r\n",
      "position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude\r\n",
      "from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified\r\n",
      "with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other\r\n",
      "hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien.*\r\n",
      "Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish must be\r\n",
      "included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the grand\r\n",
      "divisions of the entire whale host.\r\n",

      "Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\r\n",
      "whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\r\n",

      "in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\r\n",

      "shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the\r\n",

      "rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with\r\n",
      "such wondrous power and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present\r\n",

      "convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is\r\n",
      "in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon\r\n",
      "either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those\r\n",
      "marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford\r\n",
      "the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached\r\n",
      "bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How\r\n",
      "then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose\r\n",
      "peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,\r\n",
      "without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other\r\n",
      "and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked\r\n",

      "irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached,\r\n",
      "such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place\r\n",
      "as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising\r\n",
      "from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown\r\n",
      "of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The large importance attached to the harpooneer's vocation is evinced\r\n",
      "by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries\r\n",
      "and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in\r\n",
      "the person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an\r\n",
      "officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;\r\n",
      "usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In\r\n",
      "those days, the captain's authority was restricted to the navigation\r\n",
      "and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting\r\n",
      "department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer\r\n",
      "reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted\r\n",
      "title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but\r\n",
      "his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply\r\n",
      "as senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain's more\r\n",
      "inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the\r\n",
      "harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since\r\n",
      "in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat,\r\n",
      "but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling ground) the\r\n",
      "command of the ship's deck is also his; therefore the grand political\r\n",
      "maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart from\r\n",

      "their social equal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is\r\n",
      "this--the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and\r\n",

      "shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right\r\n",
      "over the Grand Turk's head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching\r\n",
      "his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so\r\n",
      "far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other\r\n",

      "the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor profoundly\r\n",
      "dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals were\r\n",
      "somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old Ahab\r\n",
      "forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief it was\r\n",
      "to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below. And\r\n",
      "poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy of this weary\r\n",
      "family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef; his would have\r\n",
      "been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help himself, this\r\n",
      "must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree. Had\r\n",
      "he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never more would he have\r\n",
      "been able to hold his head up in this honest world; nevertheless,\r\n",
      "strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask helped himself,\r\n",
      "the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it. Least of all, did\r\n",
      "Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he thought the owners\r\n",
      "of the ship denied it to him, on account of its clotting his clear,\r\n",
      "sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so long a voyage in such\r\n",
      "marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and therefore was not for\r\n",
      "him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas! was a butterless man!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask\r\n",
      "is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask's dinner was badly\r\n",
      "jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;\r\n",
      "and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb\r\n",
      "even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small\r\n",
      "appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask\r\n",
      "must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day;\r\n",
      "for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the deck.\r\n",
      "Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever since he\r\n",
      "had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he had never\r\n",
      "known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less. For what\r\n",
      "he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal in him.\r\n",
      "Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed from\r\n",
      "my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of\r\n",
      "old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before the\r\n",
      "mast. There's the fruits of promotion now; there's the vanity of glory:\r\n",
      "there's the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any mere\r\n",
      "sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask's official\r\n",
      "capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample vengeance,\r\n",
      "was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask through the cabin\r\n",
      "sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful Ahab.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table\r\n",
      "in the Pequod's cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted\r\n",
      "order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was\r\n",
      "restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three\r\n",
      "harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary legatees.\r\n",
      "They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty\r\n",
      "cabin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless\r\n",
      "invisible domineerings of the captain's table, was the entire care-free\r\n",
      "license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows\r\n",
      "the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid of the\r\n",
      "sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed their food\r\n",
      "with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined like lords;\r\n",
      "they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading with spices.\r\n",
      "Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that to fill out\r\n",
      "the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale Dough-Boy was\r\n",
      "fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly quarried out of\r\n",
      "the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he did not go with\r\n",
      "a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of\r\n",
      "accelerating him by darting a fork at his back, harpoon-wise. And once\r\n",
      "Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted Dough-Boy's memory by\r\n",
      "snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head into a great empty\r\n",
      "wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand, began laying out the\r\n",
      "circle preliminary to scalping him. He was naturally a very nervous,\r\n",
      "shuddering sort of little fellow, this bread-faced steward; the progeny\r\n",
      "of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse. And what with the standing\r\n",
      "spectacle of the black terrific Ahab, and the periodical tumultuous\r\n",
      "visitations of these three savages, Dough-Boy's whole life was one\r\n",
      "continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after seeing the harpooneers furnished\r\n",
      "with all things they demanded, he would escape from their clutches into\r\n",
      "his little pantry adjoining, and fearfully peep out at them through the\r\n",
      "blinds of its door, till all was over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing\r\n",
      "his filed teeth to the Indian's: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on the\r\n",
      "floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the low\r\n",
      "carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low cabin\r\n",
      "framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in a\r\n",
      "ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,\r\n",
      "not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively\r\n",
      "small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad,\r\n",
      "baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage fed\r\n",
      "strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through his\r\n",
      "dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by\r\n",
      "beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a\r\n",
      "mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating--an ugly sound enough--so\r\n",
      "much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether\r\n",
      "any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear\r\n",
      "Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might be\r\n",
      "picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging\r\n",
      "round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor did the\r\n",
      "whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for their\r\n",
      "lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner, they\r\n",
      "would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did not at\r\n",
      "all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget that in his\r\n",
      "Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been guilty of some\r\n",
      "murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy! hard fares the\r\n",
      "white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin should he carry on\r\n",
      "his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his great delight,\r\n",
      "the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to his credulous,\r\n",
      "fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling in them at every\r\n",
      "step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived\r\n",
      "there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were\r\n",
      "scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,\r\n",
      "when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale\r\n",
      "captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights\r\n",
      "the ship's cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that\r\n",
      "anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,\r\n",
      "the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to\r\n",
      "have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it\r\n",
      "was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for\r\n",
      "a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,\r\n",
      "residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin\r\n",
      "was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally\r\n",
      "included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He\r\n",
      "lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled\r\n",
      "Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of\r\n",
      "the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter\r\n",
      "there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age,\r\n",
      "Ahab's soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed upon the\r\n",
      "sullen paws of its gloom!\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the\r\n",
      "other seamen my first mast-head came round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost\r\n",
      "simultaneously with the vessel's leaving her port; even though she may\r\n",
      "have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper\r\n",
      "cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years' voyage\r\n",
      "she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her--say, an empty vial\r\n",
      "even--then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her\r\n",
      "skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether\r\n",
      "relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a very\r\n",
      "ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate here.\r\n",
      "I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old\r\n",
      "Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.\r\n",
      "For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by\r\n",
      "their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,\r\n",
      "or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great\r\n",
      "stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the dread\r\n",
      "gale of God's wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders\r\n",
      "priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of\r\n",
      "mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general belief among\r\n",
      "archaeologists, that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical\r\n",
      "purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stair-like\r\n",
      "formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with prodigious\r\n",
      "long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were wont to mount\r\n",
      "to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the look-outs of a\r\n",
      "modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing in sight. In\r\n",
      "Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times, who built him\r\n",
      "a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of\r\n",
      "his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the ground with a\r\n",
      "tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless\r\n",
      "stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his place by fogs\r\n",
      "or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing everything out to\r\n",
      "the last, literally died at his post. Of modern standers-of-mast-heads\r\n",
      "we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and bronze men; who,\r\n",
      "though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still entirely\r\n",
      "incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange\r\n",
      "sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of Vendome,\r\n",
      "stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the air;\r\n",
      "careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe, Louis\r\n",
      "Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft on\r\n",
      "his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules' pillars,\r\n",
      "his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals\r\n",
      "will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his\r\n",
      "mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that\r\n",
      "London smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for\r\n",
      "where there is smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor\r\n",
      "Napoleon, nor Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however\r\n",
      "madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks\r\n",
      "upon which they gaze; however it may be surmised, that their spirits\r\n",
      "penetrate through the thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals\r\n",
      "and what rocks must be shunned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head\r\n",
      "standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is\r\n",
      "not so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole\r\n",
      "historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,\r\n",
      "that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly\r\n",
      "launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected lofty\r\n",
      "spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means\r\n",
      "of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few\r\n",
      "years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand,\r\n",
      "who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh\r\n",
      "the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we then to the\r\n",
      "one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The three mast-heads\r\n",
      "are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen taking their\r\n",
      "regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other every two\r\n",
      "hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant\r\n",
      "the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful. There\r\n",
      "you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks, striding along the\r\n",
      "deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while beneath you and\r\n",
      "between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters of the sea, even\r\n",
      "as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous Colossus at old\r\n",
      "Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of the sea, with\r\n",
      "nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship indolently rolls; the\r\n",
      "drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you into languor. For the\r\n",
      "most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime uneventfulness invests\r\n",
      "you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras with startling accounts\r\n",
      "of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements; you hear\r\n",
      "of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt securities; fall of stocks; are\r\n",
      "never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinner--for\r\n",
      "all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks, and\r\n",
      "your bill of fare is immutable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years'\r\n",
      "voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the\r\n",
      "mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be\r\n",
      "deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion\r\n",
      "of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute\r\n",
      "of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a\r\n",
      "comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,\r\n",
      "a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small\r\n",
      "and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your\r\n",
      "most usual point of perch is the head of the t' gallant-mast, where you\r\n",
      "stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen) called\r\n",
      "the t' gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the beginner\r\n",
      "feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull's horns. To be sure,\r\n",
      "in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of\r\n",
      "a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more\r\n",
      "of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its\r\n",
      "fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out\r\n",
      "of it, without running great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim\r\n",
      "crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of\r\n",
      "a house as it is a mere envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You\r\n",
      "cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body, and no more can you\r\n",
      "make a convenient closet of your watch-coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\r\n",
      "southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents\r\n",
      "or pulpits, called CROW'S-NESTS, in which the look-outs of a Greenland\r\n",
      "whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In\r\n",
      "the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled \"A Voyage among the\r\n",
      "Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\r\n",
      "re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;\" in\r\n",
      "this admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with\r\n",
      "a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\r\n",
      "CROW'S-NEST of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet's good\r\n",
      "craft. He called it the SLEET'S CROW'S-NEST, in honour of himself; he\r\n",
      "being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous\r\n",
      "false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our\r\n",
      "own names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so\r\n",
      "likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we\r\n",
      "may beget. In shape, the Sleet's crow's-nest is something like a large\r\n",
      "tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is furnished with\r\n",
      "a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale.\r\n",
      "Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a\r\n",
      "little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the\r\n",
      "stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for\r\n",
      "umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather rack, in which\r\n",
      "to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and other nautical\r\n",
      "conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his mast-head in this\r\n",
      "crow's-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a rifle with him\r\n",
      "(also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask and shot, for\r\n",
      "the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or vagrant sea unicorns\r\n",
      "infesting those waters; for you cannot successfully shoot at them from\r\n",
      "the deck owing to the resistance of the water, but to shoot down upon\r\n",
      "them is a very different thing. Now, it was plainly a labor of love\r\n",
      "for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the little detailed\r\n",
      "conveniences of his crow's-nest; but though he so enlarges upon many\r\n",
      "of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his\r\n",
      "experiments in this crow's-nest, with a small compass he kept there for\r\n",
      "the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called\r\n",
      "the \"local attraction\" of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to\r\n",
      "the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship's planks, and in the\r\n",
      "Glacier's case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down\r\n",
      "blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very\r\n",
      "discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his learned \"binnacle\r\n",
      "deviations,\" \"azimuth compass observations,\" and \"approximate errors,\"\r\n",
      "he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was not so much immersed\r\n",
      "in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail being attracted\r\n",
      "occasionally towards that well replenished little case-bottle, so nicely\r\n",
      "tucked in on one side of his crow's nest, within easy reach of his hand.\r\n",
      "Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and even love the brave, the\r\n",
      "honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it very ill of him that he\r\n",
      "should so utterly ignore that case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend\r\n",
      "and comforter it must have been, while with mittened fingers and hooded\r\n",
      "head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that bird's nest\r\n",
      "within three or four perches of the pole.\r\n",

      "round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom, and\r\n",
      "round perdition's flames before I give him up. And this is what ye have\r\n",

      "unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small indignity. I\r\n",
      "meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder Turkish cheeks of\r\n",
      "spotted tawn--living, breathing pictures painted by the sun. The Pagan\r\n",
      "leopards--the unrecking and unworshipping things, that live; and seek,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked\r\n",
      "with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined,\r\n",
      "was the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and\r\n",
      "as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,\r\n",
      "that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose\r\n",

      "not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been\r\n",

      "living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old times of\r\n",
      "the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there was said\r\n",
      "to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface);\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and knowing\r\n",
      "that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had escaped\r\n",
      "alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should\r\n",
      "go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not only\r\n",
      "ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in time); that\r\n",
      "though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he would still\r\n",
      "swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick\r\n",
      "blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for again in\r\n",

      "uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,\r\n",
      "but, as was elsewhere thrown out--a peculiar snow-white wrinkled\r\n",
      "forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent\r\n",
      "features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he\r\n",
      "revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with\r\n",
      "the same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive\r\n",
      "appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by\r\n",
      "his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue\r\n",
      "sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden\r\n",
      "gleamings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his\r\n",
      "deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural terror,\r\n",
      "as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to specific\r\n",
      "accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults. More than\r\n",
      "all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught\r\n",
      "else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers, with every\r\n",
      "apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known to turn\r\n",
      "round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their boats to\r\n",
      "splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar\r\n",
      "disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual\r\n",
      "in the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale's\r\n",
      "infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death\r\n",
      "that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an\r\n",
      "unintelligent agent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of\r\n",
      "his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed\r\n",
      "boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the\r\n",
      "white curds of the whale's direful wrath into the serene, exasperating\r\n",
      "sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the\r\n",
      "eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had\r\n",
      "dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly seeking\r\n",
      "with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the whale.\r\n",
      "That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping his\r\n",
      "sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away Ahab's\r\n",
      "leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk, no\r\n",
      "hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming malice.\r\n",
      "Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that almost fatal\r\n",
      "encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale,\r\n",
      "all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came\r\n",
      "to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but all his\r\n",
      "intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam before\r\n",
      "him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which\r\n",
      "some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left living on with\r\n",
      "half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity which has been\r\n",
      "from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern Christians ascribe\r\n",
      "one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of the east reverenced\r\n",
      "in their statue devil;--Ahab did not fall down and worship it like them;\r\n",
      "but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale, he\r\n",

      "in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain; all the subtle\r\n",
      "demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy Ahab, were visibly\r\n",
      "personified, and made practically assailable in Moby Dick. He piled upon\r\n",
      "the whale's white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt\r\n",
      "by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at\r\n",

      "monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,\r\n",
      "corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he\r\n",
      "probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.\r\n",
      "Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long\r\n",
      "months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one\r\n",
      "hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape;\r\n",
      "then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another;\r\n",
      "and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward\r\n",
      "voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems\r\n",
      "all but certain from the fact that, at intervals during the passage,\r\n",
      "he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital\r\n",
      "strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified\r\n",
      "by his delirium, that his mates were forced to lace him fast, even\r\n",
      "there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung\r\n",
      "to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when running into more sufferable\r\n",
      "latitudes, the ship, with mild stun'sails spread, floated across the\r\n",
      "tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances, the old man's delirium seemed\r\n",
      "left behind him with the Cape Horn swells, and he came forth from his\r\n",
      "dark den into the blessed light and air; even then, when he bore that\r\n",
      "firm, collected front, however pale, and issued his calm orders once\r\n",
      "again; and his mates thanked God the direful madness was now gone; even\r\n",
      "then, Ahab, in his hidden self, raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a\r\n",
      "cunning and most feline thing. When you think it fled, it may have but\r\n",
      "become transfigured into some still subtler form. Ahab's full lunacy\r\n",
      "subsided not, but deepeningly contracted; like the unabated Hudson,\r\n",
      "when that noble Northman flows narrowly, but unfathomably through the\r\n",
      "Highland gorge. But, as in his narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of\r\n",
      "Ahab's broad madness had been left behind; so in that broad madness, not\r\n",
      "one jot of his great natural intellect had perished. That before living\r\n",
      "agent, now became the living instrument. If such a furious trope may\r\n",
      "stand, his special lunacy stormed his general sanity, and carried it,\r\n",
      "and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far\r\n",
      "from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a\r\n",
      "thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon\r\n",
      "any one reasonable object.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is much; yet Ahab's larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.\r\n",
      "But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding\r\n",
      "far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where\r\n",
      "we here stand--however grand and wonderful, now quit it;--and take your\r\n",
      "way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;\r\n",
      "where far beneath the fantastic towers of man's upper earth, his root\r\n",
      "of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique\r\n",
      "buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken\r\n",
      "throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he\r\n",
      "patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of\r\n",
      "ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that proud,\r\n",
      "sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young exiled\r\n",
      "royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old State-secret come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means\r\n",
      "are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or\r\n",
      "change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long\r\n",
      "dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling\r\n",
      "was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when\r\n",
      "with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him\r\n",
      "otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the\r\n",
      "terrible casualty which had overtaken him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly\r\n",

      "always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the\r\n",
      "present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,\r\n",
      "that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on\r\n",
      "account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent\r\n",
      "isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons he\r\n",
      "was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full\r\n",
      "of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and\r\n",
      "scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable\r\n",

      "his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.\r\n",
      "Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,\r\n",
      "yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on\r\n",
      "his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,\r\n",
      "that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in\r\n",
      "him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only\r\n",
      "and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one of his\r\n",
      "old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him\r\n",
      "then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the\r\n",
      "ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on profitable cruises, the\r\n",
      "profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint. He was intent on an\r\n",

      "up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals--morally enfeebled\r\n",

      "Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which\r\n",

      "yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost despair of\r\n",

      "kings of Pegu placing the title \"Lord of the White Elephants\" above all\r\n",
      "their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the modern kings\r\n",
      "of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the royal standard;\r\n",

      "Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the tropics;\r\n",
      "what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent\r\n",

      "never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious\r\n",
      "thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I\r\n",

      "that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses;\r\n",

      "beheld the Antarctic fowl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very complexion of\r\n",
      "things. Because, an interval of three hundred and sixty-five days\r\n",
      "and nights was before him; an interval which, instead of impatiently\r\n",
      "enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt; if by chance\r\n",
      "the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote from his\r\n",
      "periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow off the\r\n",
      "Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any other\r\n",
      "waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas, Nor'-Westers,\r\n",
      "Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon, might\r\n",
      "blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the Pequod's\r\n",
      "circumnavigating wake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it not\r\n",
      "but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one solitary\r\n",
      "whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of individual\r\n",
      "recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti in the\r\n",
      "thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar\r\n",
      "snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but\r\n",
      "be unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter\r\n",
      "to himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he\r\n",
      "would throw himself back in reveries--tallied him, and shall he escape?\r\n",
      "His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep's ear! And\r\n",
      "here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a weariness\r\n",
      "and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air of the\r\n",
      "deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what trances\r\n",
      "of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved\r\n",
      "revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes with his own\r\n",
      "bloody nails in his palms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid\r\n",
      "dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through\r\n",
      "the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them\r\n",
      "round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing\r\n",
      "of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was sometimes\r\n",
      "the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its\r\n",
      "base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked flames and\r\n",
      "lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among\r\n",
      "them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild cry would be\r\n",
      "heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would burst from his\r\n",
      "state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on fire. Yet these,\r\n",
      "perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent\r\n",
      "weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens\r\n",
      "of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming,\r\n",
      "unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab that had\r\n",
      "gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to burst from\r\n",
      "it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living principle or\r\n",
      "soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated from the\r\n",
      "characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its outer\r\n",
      "vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching\r\n",
      "contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was no\r\n",
      "longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with\r\n",
      "the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab's case, yielding up\r\n",
      "all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose,\r\n",
      "by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and\r\n",
      "devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own. Nay,\r\n",
      "could grimly live and burn, while the common vitality to which it was\r\n",
      "conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth.\r\n",
      "Therefore, the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes, when\r\n",
      "what seemed Ahab rushed from his room, was for the time but a vacated\r\n",
      "thing, a formless somnambulistic being, a ray of living light, to be\r\n",
      "sure, but without an object to colour, and therefore a blankness in\r\n",
      "itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts have created a creature\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after\r\n",
      "receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an\r\n",
      "interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by\r\n",
      "the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same\r\n",
      "private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where\r\n",
      "three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I\r\n",
      "think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted\r\n",
      "them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to\r\n",
      "Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far\r\n",
      "into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,\r\n",
      "often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas,\r\n",
      "with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of\r\n",
      "unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have\r\n",
      "been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,\r\n",
      "brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.\r\n",
      "This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the\r\n",
      "other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that\r\n",
      "is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack,\r\n",
      "saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards\r\n",

      "that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time\r\n",
      "distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's\r\n",
      "eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years,\r\n",
      "but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant\r\n",
      "the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable\r\n",
      "historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at\r\n",
      "distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became\r\n",
      "thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily\r\n",
      "peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar\r\n",
      "in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his\r\n",
      "peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly\r\n",
      "valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences\r\n",
      "of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about\r\n",
      "such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that\r\n",
      "most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their\r\n",
      "tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,\r\n",
      "without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some\r\n",

      "whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For\r\n",
      "this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full\r\n",

      "perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid\r\n",
      "conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.\r\n",
      "One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and\r\n",
      "deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at home,\r\n",
      "however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you suppose\r\n",

      "to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very irregular\r\n",
      "between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what might be\r\n",
      "called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I tell you\r\n",
      "that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific, among many\r\n",
      "others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which had had a\r\n",
      "death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that had each\r\n",
      "lost a boat's crew. For God's sake, be economical with your lamps and\r\n",
      "candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of man's blood was\r\n",
      "spilled for it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is\r\n",
      "an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that when\r\n",
      "narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold enormousness,\r\n",
      "they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness; when, I\r\n",
      "declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of being facetious than Moses,\r\n",

      "testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm\r\n",
      "Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously\r\n",
      "malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy, and\r\n",
      "sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale HAS done it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,\r\n",
      "was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her\r\n",
      "boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of\r\n",
      "the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping\r\n",
      "from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the\r\n",
      "ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that in\r\n",
      "less than \"ten minutes\" she settled down and fell over. Not a surviving\r\n",
      "plank of her has been seen since. After the severest exposure, part of\r\n",
      "the crew reached the land in their boats. Being returned home at last,\r\n",
      "Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific in command of another\r\n",
      "ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and\r\n",
      "breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly lost, and forthwith\r\n",
      "forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since. At this day Captain\r\n",
      "Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen Owen Chace, who was\r\n",
      "chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy; I have read his\r\n",
      "plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his son; and all\r\n",
      "this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "*The following are extracts from Chace's narrative: \"Every fact seemed\r\n",
      "to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which\r\n",
      "directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at\r\n",
      "a short interval between them, both of which, according to their\r\n",
      "direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made\r\n",
      "ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock;\r\n",
      "to effect which, the exact manoeuvres which he made were necessary. His\r\n",
      "aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated resentment and fury. He\r\n",
      "came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered, and in\r\n",
      "which we had struck three of his companions, as if fired with revenge\r\n",
      "for their sufferings.\" Again: \"At all events, the whole circumstances\r\n",
      "taken together, all happening before my own eyes, and producing, at the\r\n",
      "time, impressions in my mind of decided, calculating mischief, on the\r\n",
      "part of the whale (many of which impressions I cannot now recall),\r\n",
      "induce me to be satisfied that I am correct in my opinion.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during\r\n",
      "a black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any\r\n",
      "hospitable shore. \"The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the\r\n",
      "fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed\r\n",
      "upon hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful\r\n",
      "contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment's thought; the\r\n",
      "dismal looking wreck, and THE HORRID ASPECT AND REVENGE OF THE WHALE,\r\n",
      "wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.\"\r\n",

      "Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807\r\n",
      "totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic\r\n",
      "particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,\r\n",

      "Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J---, then\r\n",

      "the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,\r\n",
      "the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\r\n",
      "ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily\r\n",
      "denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war\r\n",
      "as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there\r\n",
      "is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this\r\n",
      "impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a\r\n",
      "portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments' confidential business\r\n",
      "with him. That business consisted in fetching the Commodore's craft such\r\n",
      "a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest\r\n",
      "port to heave down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider\r\n",
      "the Commodore's interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul\r\n",

      "clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on\r\n",
      "our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was not\r\n",

      "uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship itself,\r\n",
      "lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived by any\r\n",
      "one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full sail,\r\n",
      "was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its striking\r\n",
      "against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger, as this\r\n",
      "gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three feet at\r\n",
      "least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell altogether,\r\n",
      "while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck, concluding\r\n",
      "that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw the monster\r\n",
      "sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain D'Wolf\r\n",
      "applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel\r\n",

      "loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves widely,\r\n",
      "so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their eyes again\r\n",
      "riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of the other\r\n",
      "boats obeyed not the command.\r\n",

      "\"Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little\r\n",

      "more the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone--devils\r\n",

      "you snap your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,\r\n",
      "then:--softly, softly! That's it--that's it! long and strong. Give way\r\n",
      "there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are\r\n",
      "all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull,\r\n",
      "can't ye? pull, won't ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes\r\n",
      "don't ye pull?--pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!\r\n",

      "Stubb's exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had\r\n",
      "rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in\r\n",
      "inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this\r\n",
      "specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions\r\n",
      "with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief\r\n",
      "peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a\r\n",
      "tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so\r\n",

      "queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling for\r\n",
      "the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy and\r\n",
      "indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so broadly\r\n",
      "gaped--open-mouthed at times--that the mere sight of such a yawning\r\n",
      "commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon the crew.\r\n",
      "Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists, whose jollity\r\n",
      "is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all inferiors on their\r\n",
      "guard in the matter of obeying them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely\r\n",
      "across Stubb's bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were\r\n",
      "pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Halloa!\" returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he\r\n",

      "what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long\r\n",

      "Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant\r\n",
      "as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably\r\n",

      "company; but Archy's fancied discovery having some time previous got\r\n",
      "abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some\r\n",
      "small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge\r\n",
      "of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb's confident way\r\n",
      "of accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from\r\n",
      "superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room for\r\n",
      "all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab's precise agency in the\r\n",
      "matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the mysterious\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the\r\n",
      "furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a\r\n",
      "circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger\r\n",
      "yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five\r\n",
      "trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which\r\n",
      "periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst\r\n",

      "displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the\r\n",
      "gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery\r\n",
      "horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a\r\n",
      "fencer's, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance any\r\n",
      "tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in\r\n",
      "a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All at once\r\n",
      "the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed,\r\n",
      "while the boat's five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat and\r\n",
      "crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in the\r\n",
      "rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily\r\n",
      "down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the\r\n",
      "movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Every man look out along his oars!\" cried Starbuck. \"Thou, Queequeg,\r\n",
      "stand up!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage\r\n",
      "stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the\r\n",
      "spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme\r\n",
      "stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with\r\n",
      "the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing\r\n",
      "himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently\r\n",
      "eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not very far distant Flask's boat was also lying breathlessly still; its\r\n",
      "commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a stout\r\n",
      "sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above the\r\n",
      "level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the\r\n",
      "whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man's hand,\r\n",
      "and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the\r\n",
      "mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little\r\n",
      "King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post was\r\n",
      "full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead stand-point\r\n",
      "of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can't see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to\r\n",

      "shoulders for a pedestal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you\r\n",
      "fifty feet taller.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the\r\n",
      "boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to\r\n",
      "Flask's foot, and then putting Flask's hand on his hearse-plumed head\r\n",
      "and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous\r\n",
      "fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was\r\n",
      "Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a\r\n",
      "breastband to lean against and steady himself by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous\r\n",
      "habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect\r\n",
      "posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously\r\n",
      "perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily\r\n",
      "perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the\r\n",
      "sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more curious;\r\n",
      "for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy, unthought of,\r\n",
      "barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously\r\n",
      "rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired Flask seemed\r\n",
      "a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider. Though truly\r\n",
      "vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now and then\r\n",
      "stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby give to\r\n",
      "the negro's lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity stamping the\r\n",
      "living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her tides and her\r\n",
      "seasons for that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing\r\n",
      "solicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,\r\n",
      "not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,\r\n",
      "Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the\r\n",
      "languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,\r\n",
      "where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed\r\n",
      "home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his match\r\n",
      "across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his harpooneer,\r\n",
      "whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars, suddenly\r\n",
      "dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat, crying out in a\r\n",
      "quick phrensy of hurry, \"Down, down all, and give way!--there they are!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been\r\n",
      "visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white\r\n",
      "water, and thin scattered puffs of vapour hovering over it, and\r\n",
      "suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white\r\n",
      "rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it\r\n",
      "were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this\r\n",
      "atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of\r\n",
      "water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other\r\n",
      "indications, the puffs of vapour they spouted, seemed their forerunning\r\n",
      "couriers and detached flying outriders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled\r\n",
      "water and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on,\r\n",
      "as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the\r\n",
      "hills.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pull, pull, my good boys,\" said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but\r\n",
      "intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance\r\n",
      "from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two\r\n",
      "visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much\r\n",
      "to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the\r\n",
      "silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his\r\n",
      "peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How different the loud little King-Post. \"Sing out and say something,\r\n",
      "my hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on their\r\n",
      "black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I'll sign over to you my\r\n",
      "Martha's Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children, boys.\r\n",
      "Lay me on--lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring mad!\r\n",
      "See! see that white water!\" And so shouting, he pulled his hat from his\r\n",
      "head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up, flirted it far\r\n",
      "off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boat's\r\n",
      "stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look at that chap now,\" philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his\r\n",
      "unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a\r\n",
      "short distance, followed after--\"He's got fits, that Flask has. Fits?\r\n",
      "yes, give him fits--that's the very word--pitch fits into 'em. Merrily,\r\n",
      "merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;--merry's the word.\r\n",
      "Pull, babes--pull, sucklings--pull, all. But what the devil are you\r\n",
      "hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and\r\n",
      "keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your\r\n",
      "knives in two--that's all. Take it easy--why don't ye take it easy, I\r\n",
      "say, and burst all your livers and lungs!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of\r\n",
      "his--these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed\r\n",
      "light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious\r\n",
      "seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of\r\n",
      "red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of\r\n",
      "Flask to \"that whale,\" as he called the fictitious monster which\r\n",
      "he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat's bow with its\r\n",
      "tail--these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that\r\n",
      "they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look\r\n",
      "over the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen\r\n",
      "must put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage\r\n",
      "pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but\r\n",
      "arms, in these critical moments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the\r\n",
      "omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled along\r\n",
      "the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowling-green;\r\n",
      "the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip for an instant on\r\n",
      "the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost seemed threatening\r\n",
      "to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and\r\n",
      "hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite\r\n",
      "hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other side;--all these,\r\n",
      "with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and the shuddering gasps\r\n",
      "of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the ivory Pequod bearing\r\n",
      "down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like a wild hen after her\r\n",
      "screaming brood;--all this was thrilling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever\r\n",
      "heat of his first battle; not the dead man's ghost encountering the\r\n",
      "first unknown phantom in the other world;--neither of these can feel\r\n",
      "stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first\r\n",
      "time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the\r\n",
      "hunted sperm whale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more\r\n",
      "visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows\r\n",
      "flung upon the sea. The jets of vapour no longer blended, but tilted\r\n",
      "everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.\r\n",
      "The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales\r\n",
      "running dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still\r\n",
      "rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through\r\n",
      "the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to\r\n",
      "escape being torn from the row-locks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Give way, men,\" whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the sheet\r\n",

      "There's white water again!--close to! Spring!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted\r\n",
      "that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when\r\n",
      "with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: \"Stand up!\" and\r\n",
      "Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril\r\n",
      "so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance\r\n",
      "of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent\r\n",
      "instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of\r\n",
      "fifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still\r\n",
      "booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like\r\n",
      "the erected crests of enraged serpents.\r\n",

      "Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from\r\n",
      "astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail\r\n",

      "increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps\r\n",
      "every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our\r\n",
      "Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their whole\r\n",

      "full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length; that is, if it lie\r\n",
      "along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other reasonable retreat\r\n",

      "the upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way\r\n",
      "expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a\r\n",
      "coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness\r\n",
      "touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or\r\n",
      "on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when\r\n",

      "clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen--that bubbling from the pumps\r\n",

      "over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his\r\n",
      "superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he\r\n",
      "conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a\r\n",
      "chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern's tower, and\r\n",
      "make a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,\r\n",
      "gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a\r\n",
      "head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings\r\n",
      "of your last viceroy's snorting charger; and a brain, and a heart, and\r\n",
      "a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt Charlemagne, had he\r\n",

      "of ye, and let's have a taste. By the Lord, it's worth bottling! I tell\r\n",
      "ye what, men, old Rad's investment must go for it! he had best cut away\r\n",
      "his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that sword-fish\r\n",
      "only began the job; he's come back again with a gang of ship-carpenters,\r\n",
      "saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole posse of 'em\r\n",
      "are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom; making\r\n",
      "improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I'd tell him to jump\r\n",
      "overboard and scatter 'em. They're playing the devil with his estate, I\r\n",
      "can tell him. But he's a simple old soul,--Rad, and a beauty too. Boys,\r\n",
      "they say the rest of his property is invested in looking-glasses. I\r\n",
      "wonder if he'd give a poor devil like me the model of his nose.'\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"'Aye, aye, sir,' said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. 'Lively, boys,\r\n",
      "lively, now!' And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;\r\n",
      "the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping\r\n",
      "of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life's\r\n",
      "utmost energies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went\r\n",
      "forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face\r\n",
      "fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his\r\n",
      "brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney\r\n",
      "to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know\r\n",
      "not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate\r\n",
      "commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a\r\n",
      "shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig\r\n",
      "to run at large.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship's deck at sea is a piece of household\r\n",
      "work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every\r\n",
      "evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually\r\n",
      "foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of\r\n",
      "sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom\r\n",
      "would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all\r\n",
      "vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,\r\n",
      "if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho\r\n",
      "that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being\r\n",
      "the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly\r\n",
      "assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should have\r\n",
      "been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical\r\n",
      "duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all these\r\n",
      "particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood\r\n",
      "between the two men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as\r\n",
      "plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat\r\n",
      "in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will\r\n",
      "understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman fully\r\n",
      "comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat still for\r\n",
      "a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate's malignant eye and\r\n",
      "perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him and the slow-match\r\n",
      "silently burning along towards them; as he instinctively saw all\r\n",
      "this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper\r\n",
      "passionateness in any already ireful being--a repugnance most felt, when\r\n",
      "felt at all, by really valiant men even when aggrieved--this nameless\r\n",
      "phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over Steelkilt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily\r\n",
      "exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping\r\n",
      "the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then, without\r\n",
      "at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the customary\r\n",
      "sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done little or\r\n",
      "nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a most\r\n",
      "domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his\r\n",
      "command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an\r\n",
      "uplifted cooper's club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for\r\n",
      "all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt\r\n",
      "could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still\r\n",
      "smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained\r\n",
      "doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the\r\n",
      "hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do\r\n",
      "his bidding.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily\r\n",
      "followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated his\r\n",
      "intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had not\r\n",
      "the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his\r\n",
      "twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it was to\r\n",
      "no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass;\r\n",
      "when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him that he had\r\n",
      "now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the Lakeman paused on\r\n",
      "the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to\r\n",
      "yourself.' But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where\r\n",
      "the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of\r\n",
      "his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.\r\n",
      "Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye\r\n",
      "with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching\r\n",
      "his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his\r\n",
      "persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would\r\n",
      "murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter\r\n",
      "by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant\r\n",

      "something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the\r\n",
      "eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored\r\n",
      "alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.\r\n",
      "It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those\r\n",
      "curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day\r\n",
      "confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the\r\n",
      "world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all\r\n",
      "wrong.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will\r\n",
      "be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For\r\n",
      "ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble\r\n",
      "panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,\r\n",
      "medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of\r\n",
      "chain-armor like Saladin's, and a helmeted head like St. George's; ever\r\n",
      "since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not\r\n",
      "only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific\r\n",
      "presentations of him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to\r\n",
      "be the whale's, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of Elephanta,\r\n",
      "in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of\r\n",
      "that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits, every conceivable\r\n",
      "avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of them actually came\r\n",
      "into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our noble profession of\r\n",
      "whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The Hindoo whale\r\n",
      "referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall, depicting the\r\n",
      "incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly known as the\r\n",
      "Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and half whale, so\r\n",
      "as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small section of him is\r\n",
      "all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda, than the\r\n",
      "broad palms of the true whale's majestic flukes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian painter's\r\n",
      "portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian\r\n",
      "Hindoo. It is Guido's picture of Perseus rescuing Andromeda from the\r\n",
      "sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model of such a strange\r\n",
      "creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the same scene in his\r\n",
      "own \"Perseus Descending,\" make out one whit better. The huge corpulence\r\n",
      "of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the surface, scarcely drawing\r\n",
      "one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on its back, and its\r\n",
      "distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling, might be\r\n",
      "taken for the Traitors' Gate leading from the Thames by water into the\r\n",
      "Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old Scotch Sibbald, and\r\n",
      "Jonah's whale, as depicted in the prints of old Bibles and the cuts of\r\n",
      "old primers. What shall be said of these? As for the book-binder's whale\r\n",
      "winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a descending anchor--as\r\n",
      "stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of many books both\r\n",
      "old and new--that is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature,\r\n",
      "imitated, I take it, from the like figures on antique vases.\r\n",
      "Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless call this\r\n",
      "book-binder's fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so intended\r\n",
      "when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an old\r\n",
      "Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the Revival\r\n",
      "of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a comparatively\r\n",
      "late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the\r\n",
      "Leviathan.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will\r\n",
      "at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all manner\r\n",
      "of spouts, jets d'eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and Baden-Baden,\r\n",
      "come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the title-page of the\r\n",
      "original edition of the \"Advancement of Learning\" you will find some\r\n",
      "curious whales.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those\r\n",
      "pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,\r\n",
      "by those who know. In old Harris's collection of voyages there are some\r\n",
      "plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,\r\n",
      "entitled \"A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the\r\n",
      "Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.\" In one of those plates the\r\n",
      "whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among ice-isles,\r\n",
      "with white bears running over their living backs. In another plate, the\r\n",
      "prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular\r\n",
      "flukes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain Colnett,\r\n",
      "a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled \"A Voyage round Cape Horn\r\n",
      "into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the Spermaceti Whale\r\n",
      "Fisheries.\" In this book is an outline purporting to be a \"Picture of\r\n",
      "a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from one killed on the\r\n",
      "coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.\" I doubt not the\r\n",
      "captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines.\r\n",
      "To mention but one thing about it, let me say that it has an eye which\r\n",
      "applied, according to the accompanying scale, to a full grown sperm\r\n",
      "whale, would make the eye of that whale a bow-window some five feet\r\n",
      "long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not give us Jonah looking out\r\n",
      "of that eye!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for\r\n",
      "the benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of\r\n",
      "mistake. Look at that popular work \"Goldsmith's Animated Nature.\" In the\r\n",
      "abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged \"whale\"\r\n",
      "and a \"narwhale.\" I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this unsightly\r\n",
      "whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the narwhale, one\r\n",
      "glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this nineteenth century\r\n",
      "such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent\r\n",
      "public of schoolboys.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacepede, a great\r\n",
      "naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are\r\n",
      "several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these\r\n",
      "are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland\r\n",
      "whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long\r\n",
      "experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its\r\n",
      "counterpart in nature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was\r\n",
      "reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous\r\n",
      "Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he\r\n",
      "gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that\r\n",
      "picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary\r\n",
      "retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier's Sperm Whale is not\r\n",
      "a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of\r\n",
      "a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that\r\n",
      "picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor\r\n",
      "in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that\r\n",
      "is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the pencil\r\n",
      "those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the sign-painters' whales seen in the streets hanging over the\r\n",
      "shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally\r\n",
      "Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage; breakfasting\r\n",
      "on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of mariners:\r\n",
      "their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very\r\n",
      "surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have\r\n",
      "been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a\r\n",
      "drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent\r\n",
      "the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.\r\n",
      "Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan\r\n",
      "has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale,\r\n",
      "in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in\r\n",
      "unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight,\r\n",
      "like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a\r\n",
      "thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the\r\n",
      "air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not\r\n",
      "to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young\r\n",
      "sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the\r\n",
      "case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship's deck, such\r\n",
      "is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that\r\n",
      "his precise expression the devil himself could not catch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded\r\n",
      "whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at all.\r\n",
      "For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that\r\n",
      "his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy\r\n",
      "Bentham's skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of\r\n",
      "his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian\r\n",
      "old gentleman, with all Jeremy's other leading personal characteristics;\r\n",
      "yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan's\r\n",
      "articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton\r\n",
      "of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded\r\n",
      "animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes\r\n",
      "it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some\r\n",
      "part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously\r\n",
      "displayed in the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to\r\n",
      "the bones of the human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four\r\n",
      "regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But\r\n",
      "all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human\r\n",
      "fingers in an artificial covering. \"However recklessly the whale may\r\n",
      "sometimes serve us,\" said humorous Stubb one day, \"he can never be truly\r\n",

      "with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks, swarming\r\n",
      "round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness. The few\r\n",
      "sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping\r\n",
      "of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the sleepers'\r\n",
      "hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as before you\r\n",
      "heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and turning over on\r\n",
      "their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the\r\n",
      "bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the shark seems all\r\n",
      "but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable surface, they\r\n",
      "contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains a part of the\r\n",
      "universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave on the whale,\r\n",
      "may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking\r\n",
      "for a screw.\r\n",

      "every killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant\r\n",
      "butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other's\r\n",
      "live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,\r\n",
      "also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away\r\n",
      "under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the whole\r\n",
      "affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing, that\r\n",
      "is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties; and\r\n",
      "though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships\r\n",
      "crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy in\r\n",

      "socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no\r\n",
      "conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless\r\n",
      "numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm\r\n",

      "The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously\r\n",

      "limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which, after a clumsy\r\n",
      "fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old Ebony floundered\r\n",
      "along, and in obedience to the word of command, came to a dead stop on\r\n",
      "the opposite side of Stubb's sideboard; when, with both hands folded\r\n",
      "before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he bowed his arched back\r\n",

      "welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must\r\n",

      "sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other hand\r\n",
      "he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in a\r\n",

      "mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the\r\n",
      "question. \"Where were you born, cook?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"'Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin' ober de Roanoke.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Born in a ferry-boat! That's queer, too. But I want to know what\r\n",
      "country you were born in, cook!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Didn't I say de Roanoke country?\" he cried sharply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, you didn't, cook; but I'll tell you what I'm coming to, cook.\r\n",
      "You must go home and be born over again; you don't know how to cook a\r\n",
      "whale-steak yet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,\" he growled, angrily, turning round\r\n",
      "to depart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Come back here, cook;--here, hand me those tongs;--now take that bit of\r\n",

      "Take it, I say\"--holding the tongs towards him--\"take it, and taste it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro\r\n",
      "muttered, \"Best cooked 'teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.\"\r\n",

      "you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his\r\n",
      "beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here, and\r\n",
      "tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?\" said Stubb. \"Where\r\n",

      "keeping it there very solemnly.\r\n",

      "\"So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when you\r\n",

      "crawling through the lubber's hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don't\r\n",
      "get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It's a\r\n",
      "ticklish business, but must be done, or else it's no go. But none of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,\r\n",

      "you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for my\r\n",
      "private table here, the capstan, I'll tell you what to do so as not to\r\n",
      "spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live coal\r\n",

      "like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so\r\n",
      "outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and\r\n",
      "philosophy of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right\r\n",
      "Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large\r\n",
      "prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth's time, a certain cook of the\r\n",
      "court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be\r\n",
      "eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of\r\n",
      "whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The\r\n",
      "meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being well\r\n",
      "seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.\r\n",
      "The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great\r\n",
      "porpoise grant from the crown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all\r\n",
      "hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but\r\n",
      "when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet\r\n",
      "long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men\r\n",
      "like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are not\r\n",
      "so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare\r\n",
      "old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous\r\n",
      "doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly\r\n",
      "juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who\r\n",
      "long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel--that\r\n",
      "these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of\r\n",
      "whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among\r\n",
      "the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called \"fritters\"; which, indeed,\r\n",
      "they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something\r\n",
      "like old Amsterdam housewives' dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh. They\r\n",
      "have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can hardly\r\n",
      "keep his hands off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his\r\n",
      "exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be\r\n",
      "delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as\r\n",
      "the buffalo's (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid\r\n",
      "pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that\r\n",
      "is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the\r\n",
      "third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for\r\n",
      "butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into\r\n",
      "some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try\r\n",
      "watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their\r\n",
      "ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many\r\n",

      "In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine dish.\r\n",
      "The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two plump,\r\n",
      "whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large puddings),\r\n",
      "they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most delectable mess,\r\n",
      "in flavor somewhat resembling calves' head, which is quite a dish among\r\n",
      "some epicures; and every one knows that some young bucks among the\r\n",
      "epicures, by continually dining upon calves' brains, by and by get to\r\n",
      "have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to tell a\r\n",
      "calf's head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires uncommon\r\n",
      "discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with an\r\n",
      "intelligent looking calf's head before him, is somehow one of the\r\n",
      "saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at\r\n",
      "him, with an \"Et tu Brute!\" expression.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively\r\n",
      "unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence;\r\n",
      "that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration before\r\n",
      "mentioned: i.e. that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea,\r\n",
      "and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man that ever\r\n",

      "freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded\r\n",
      "the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby\r\n",
      "he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and\r\n",

      "forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to be any\r\n",
      "way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass that\r\n",
      "Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all\r\n",
      "this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and\r\n",
      "mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand\r\n",
      "than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole\r\n",
      "command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure.\r\n",
      "The sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before\r\n",

      "homage, as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however\r\n",
      "wondrous, they are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking\r\n",
      "in respect to the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as\r\n",

      "of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional caprices\r\n",

      "warrant.\r\n",

      "When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story\r\n",

      "leagued with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of Moby\r\n",
      "Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this intelligence,\r\n",
      "Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the White\r\n",
      "Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering insanity,\r\n",
      "pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the Shaker God\r\n",
      "incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some year or two\r\n",
      "afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the mast-heads, Macey, the\r\n",
      "chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him; and the captain himself\r\n",
      "being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity, despite all\r\n",
      "the archangel's denunciations and forewarnings, Macey succeeded in\r\n",

      "much weary pulling, and many perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last\r\n",
      "succeeded in getting one iron fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to\r\n",
      "the main-royal mast-head, was tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and\r\n",
      "hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants\r\n",
      "of his divinity. Now, while Macey, the mate, was standing up in his\r\n",
      "boat's bow, and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting\r\n",
      "his wild exclamations upon the whale, and essaying to get a fair chance\r\n",
      "for his poised lance, lo! a broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its\r\n",
      "quick, fanning motion, temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies\r\n",
      "of the oarsmen. Next instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious\r\n",
      "life, was smitten bodily into the air, and making a long arc in his\r\n",
      "descent, fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a\r\n",

      "whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence;\r\n",
      "because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically\r\n",
      "fore-announced it, instead of only making a general prophecy, which any\r\n",
      "one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the\r\n",
      "wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror to the ship.\r\n",

      "to his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with\r\n",
      "downward pointed finger--\"Think, think of the blasphemer--dead, and down\r\n",

      "attaining an age of two or three years or more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely tumbled,\r\n",
      "damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in consequence\r\n",
      "of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a letter, Death\r\n",
      "himself might well have been the post-boy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Can'st not read it?\" cried Ahab. \"Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it's but\r\n",
      "a dim scrawl;--what's this?\" As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a\r\n",
      "long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to\r\n",
      "insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without\r\n",
      "its coming any closer to the ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, \"Mr. Har--yes, Mr.\r\n",
      "Harry--(a woman's pinny hand,--the man's wife, I'll wager)--Aye--Mr.\r\n",
      "Harry Macey, Ship Jeroboam;--why it's Macey, and he's dead!\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Curses throttle thee!\" yelled Ahab. \"Captain Mayhew, stand by now to\r\n",
      "receive it\"; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck's hands, he\r\n",
      "caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the boat.\r\n",
      "But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing; the boat\r\n",
      "drifted a little towards the ship's stern; so that, as if by magic, the\r\n",
      "letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel's eager hand. He clutched it\r\n",
      "in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the letter on it,\r\n",
      "sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab's feet. Then\r\n",
      "Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars, and in\r\n",

      "was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the\r\n",

      "whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged, excepting the\r\n",
      "immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten feet below the\r\n",
      "level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about, half on the\r\n",
      "whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like a tread-mill\r\n",
      "beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured in the\r\n",
      "Highland costume--a shirt and socks--in which to my eyes, at least,\r\n",

      "Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right\r\n",
      "Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales regularly\r\n",
      "hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two extremes of all\r\n",
      "the known varieties of the whale. As the external difference between\r\n",
      "them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a head of each is this\r\n",
      "moment hanging from the Pequod's side; and as we may freely go from one\r\n",
      "to the other, by merely stepping across the deck:--where, I should like\r\n",
      "to know, will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology\r\n",
      "than here?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between these\r\n",
      "heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a certain\r\n",
      "mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale's which the Right Whale's sadly\r\n",
      "lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale's head. As you behold\r\n",
      "it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him, in point\r\n",
      "of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this dignity is\r\n",
      "heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit,\r\n",
      "giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he is what\r\n",
      "the fishermen technically call a \"grey-headed whale.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads--namely, the two\r\n",
      "most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of\r\n",
      "the head, and low down, near the angle of either whale's jaw, if you\r\n",
      "narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would\r\n",
      "fancy to be a young colt's eye; so out of all proportion is it to the\r\n",
      "magnitude of the head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale's eyes, it is\r\n",
      "plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more\r\n",
      "than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale's\r\n",
      "eyes corresponds to that of a man's ears; and you may fancy, for\r\n",
      "yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects\r\n",
      "through your ears. You would find that you could only command some\r\n",
      "thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;\r\n",
      "and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking\r\n",
      "straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not\r\n",
      "be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from\r\n",
      "behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the\r\n",
      "same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes the\r\n",
      "front of a man--what, indeed, but his eyes?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes\r\n",
      "are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to\r\n",
      "produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of\r\n",
      "the whale's eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of\r\n",
      "solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating\r\n",
      "two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the\r\n",
      "impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,\r\n",
      "must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct\r\n",
      "picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and\r\n",
      "nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the world\r\n",
      "from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with the\r\n",
      "whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two distinct\r\n",
      "windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the whale's\r\n",
      "eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and to be\r\n",
      "remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this\r\n",
      "visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a\r\n",
      "hint. So long as a man's eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing\r\n",
      "is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing\r\n",
      "whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one's experience\r\n",
      "will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of\r\n",
      "things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively,\r\n",
      "and completely, to examine any two things--however large or however\r\n",
      "small--at one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side\r\n",
      "by side and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two\r\n",
      "objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in\r\n",
      "order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to\r\n",
      "bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary\r\n",
      "consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes,\r\n",
      "in themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more\r\n",
      "comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man's, that he can at the same\r\n",
      "moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one\r\n",
      "side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he\r\n",
      "can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able\r\n",
      "simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems\r\n",
      "in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any incongruity in this\r\n",
      "comparison.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the\r\n",
      "extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when\r\n",
      "beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer\r\n",
      "frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly\r\n",
      "proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their\r\n",
      "divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an\r\n",
      "entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads\r\n",
      "for hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf\r\n",
      "whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so\r\n",
      "wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With\r\n",
      "respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed\r\n",
      "between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has\r\n",
      "an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered\r\n",
      "over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the\r\n",
      "world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear which\r\n",
      "is smaller than a hare's? But if his eyes were broad as the lens of\r\n",
      "Herschel's great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of\r\n",
      "cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of\r\n",
      "hearing? Not at all.--Why then do you try to \"enlarge\" your mind?\r\n",
      "Subtilize it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant\r\n",
      "over the sperm whale's head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending\r\n",
      "by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not\r\n",
      "that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we\r\n",
      "might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But\r\n",
      "let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What\r\n",
      "a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,\r\n",
      "lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as\r\n",
      "bridal satins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems\r\n",
      "like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one\r\n",
      "end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,\r\n",
      "and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,\r\n",
      "alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these\r\n",
      "spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,\r\n",
      "when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there\r\n",
      "suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging\r\n",
      "straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a\r\n",
      "ship's jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of\r\n",
      "sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his\r\n",
      "jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a\r\n",
      "reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In most cases this lower jaw--being easily unhinged by a practised\r\n",
      "artist--is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting\r\n",
      "the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone\r\n",
      "with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,\r\n",
      "including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an\r\n",

      "the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being\r\n",
      "rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag\r\n",
      "stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally forty-two\r\n",
      "teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed; nor filled\r\n",

      "As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale's head may be compared to a\r\n",
      "Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly rounded);\r\n",
      "so, at a broad view, the Right Whale's head bears a rather inelegant\r\n",
      "resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred years ago an\r\n",
      "old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemaker's last. And\r\n",
      "in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the nursery tale, with\r\n",

      "aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit and\r\n",
      "look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole head\r\n",

      "crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass--this green,\r\n",
      "barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the \"crown,\" and the\r\n",
      "Southern fishers the \"bonnet\" of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes\r\n",
      "solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,\r\n",

      "technical term \"crown\" also bestowed upon it; in which case you will\r\n",
      "take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a\r\n",
      "diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for\r\n",
      "him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a very\r\n",

      "what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by carpenter's\r\n",

      "that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.\r\n",

      "road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet high, and runs to a\r\n",
      "pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular ridge-pole there; while\r\n",

      "side, which depending from the upper part of the head or crown\r\n",
      "bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily\r\n",
      "mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres,\r\n",
      "through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in whose\r\n",
      "intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes through\r\n",
      "the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of bone, as they\r\n",

      "rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the\r\n",
      "upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these\r\n",

      "side lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then\r\n",
      "dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,\r\n",
      "and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first\r\n",
      "thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that\r\n",
      "was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;--he had\r\n",
      "thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a\r\n",
      "somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in\r\n",
      "the good old way--head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was\r\n",
      "doing as well as could be expected.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of Queequeg,\r\n",

      "momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of\r\n",
      "the headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up\r\n",
      "proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry\r\n",

      "his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick's boat was nigh to\r\n",
      "capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;--that was\r\n",
      "a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took a\r\n",
      "mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German's quarter.\r\n",
      "An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the whale's\r\n",

      "foaming swell that he made.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was\r\n",
      "now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual\r\n",
      "tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of\r\n",
      "fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering flight,\r\n",
      "and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank in the\r\n",
      "sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So have I\r\n",
      "seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the\r\n",
      "air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird has a\r\n",
      "voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the fear\r\n",
      "of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted in him;\r\n",
      "he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his spiracle,\r\n",
      "and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while still, in his\r\n",
      "amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there was enough to\r\n",
      "appal the stoutest man who so pitied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod's\r\n",
      "boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick\r\n",
      "chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart,\r\n",
      "ere the last chance would for ever escape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all three\r\n",
      "tigers--Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo--instinctively sprang to their feet,\r\n",
      "and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their barbs; and\r\n",
      "darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three Nantucket\r\n",
      "irons entered the whale. Blinding vapours of foam and white-fire! The\r\n",
      "three boats, in the first fury of the whale's headlong rush, bumped\r\n",
      "the German's aside with such force, that both Derick and his baffled\r\n",
      "harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three flying keels.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't be afraid, my butter-boxes,\" cried Stubb, casting a passing\r\n",
      "glance upon them as he shot by; \"ye'll be picked up presently--all\r\n",
      "right--I saw some sharks astern--St. Bernard's dogs, you know--relieve\r\n",
      "distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel a\r\n",
      "sunbeam! Hurrah!--Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad\r\n",
      "cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on\r\n",
      "a plain--makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to him that\r\n",
      "way; and there's danger of being pitched out too, when you strike a\r\n",
      "hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he's going to Davy\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But the monster's run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he\r\n",
      "tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round\r\n",
      "the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;\r\n",
      "while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would\r\n",
      "soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they\r\n",
      "caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at\r\n",
      "last--owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of\r\n",
      "the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue--the\r\n",
      "gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three\r\n",
      "sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound,\r\n",
      "for some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more\r\n",
      "line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have\r\n",
      "been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this \"holding on,\" as it\r\n",
      "is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from\r\n",
      "the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising\r\n",
      "again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the peril\r\n",
      "of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always the\r\n",
      "best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the stricken\r\n",
      "whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because, owing to the\r\n",
      "enormous surface of him--in a full grown sperm whale something less than\r\n",
      "2000 square feet--the pressure of the water is immense. We all know\r\n",
      "what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under; even\r\n",
      "here, above-ground, in the air; how vast, then, the burden of a whale,\r\n",
      "bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at\r\n",
      "least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated\r\n",
      "it at the weight of twenty line-of-battle ships, with all their guns,\r\n",
      "and stores, and men on board.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down\r\n",
      "into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any\r\n",
      "sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;\r\n",
      "what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and\r\n",
      "placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in\r\n",
      "agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.\r\n",
      "Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan\r\n",
      "was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and\r\n",
      "to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was\r\n",
      "once so triumphantly said--\"Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?\r\n",
      "or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him cannot\r\n",
      "hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron as\r\n",
      "straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;\r\n",
      "he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!\" This the creature? this he? Oh!\r\n",
      "that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength\r\n",
      "of a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the\r\n",
      "mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod's fish-spears!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats\r\n",
      "sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad\r\n",
      "enough to shade half Xerxes' army. Who can tell how appalling to the\r\n",
      "wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stand by, men; he stirs,\" cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly\r\n",
      "vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by\r\n",
      "magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every\r\n",
      "oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part\r\n",
      "from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce\r\n",
      "upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are\r\n",
      "scared from it into the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Haul in! Haul in!\" cried Starbuck again; \"he's rising.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand's breadth\r\n",
      "could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all\r\n",
      "dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two\r\n",
      "ship's lengths of the hunters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land animals\r\n",
      "there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins, whereby\r\n",
      "when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in\r\n",
      "certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities\r\n",
      "it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so\r\n",
      "that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly\r\n",
      "drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is\r\n",
      "heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance\r\n",
      "below the surface, his life may be said to pour from him in incessant\r\n",
      "streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him, and so distant\r\n",
      "and numerous its interior fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and\r\n",
      "bleeding for a considerable period; even as in a drought a river will\r\n",
      "flow, whose source is in the well-springs of far-off and undiscernible\r\n",
      "hills. Even now, when the boats pulled upon this whale, and perilously\r\n",
      "drew over his swaying flukes, and the lances were darted into him,\r\n",
      "they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound, which kept\r\n",
      "continually playing, while the natural spout-hole in his head was only\r\n",
      "at intervals, however rapid, sending its affrighted moisture into the\r\n",
      "air. From this last vent no blood yet came, because no vital part of him\r\n",
      "had thus far been struck. His life, as they significantly call it, was\r\n",
      "untouched.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of\r\n",
      "his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly\r\n",
      "revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were\r\n",
      "beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the\r\n",
      "noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale's eyes\r\n",
      "had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.\r\n",
      "But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his\r\n",
      "blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light the\r\n",
      "gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate the\r\n",
      "solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all.\r\n",
      "Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a strangely\r\n",
      "discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low down on the\r\n",
      "flank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A nice spot,\" cried Flask; \"just let me prick him there once.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Avast!\" cried Starbuck, \"there's no need of that!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an\r\n",
      "ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more than\r\n",
      "sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift fury\r\n",
      "blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying crews\r\n",
      "all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask's boat and marring the\r\n",
      "bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he by\r\n",
      "loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had\r\n",
      "made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,\r\n",
      "then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up\r\n",
      "the white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most\r\n",
      "piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water\r\n",
      "is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled\r\n",
      "melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the\r\n",
      "ground--so the last long dying spout of the whale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body\r\n",
      "showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled. Immediately,\r\n",
      "by Starbuck's orders, lines were secured to it at different points, so\r\n",
      "that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken whale being suspended a\r\n",
      "few inches beneath them by the cords. By very heedful management, when\r\n",
      "the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred to her side, and was\r\n",
      "strongly secured there by the stiffest fluke-chains, for it was plain\r\n",
      "that unless artificially upheld, the body would at once sink to the\r\n",
      "bottom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,\r\n",
      "the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh,\r\n",
      "on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the stumps of\r\n",
      "harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales,\r\n",
      "with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence of any\r\n",
      "kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have been\r\n",
      "some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for\r\n",
      "the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a\r\n",
      "lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,\r\n",
      "the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And\r\n",
      "when? It might have been darted by some Nor' West Indian long before\r\n",
      "America was discovered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous\r\n",
      "cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further\r\n",
      "discoveries, by the ship's being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways\r\n",
      "to the sea, owing to the body's immensely increasing tendency to sink.\r\n",
      "However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to the\r\n",
      "last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the ship\r\n",
      "would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with the\r\n",
      "body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such was\r\n",
      "the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the fluke-chains and\r\n",
      "cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast them off. Meantime\r\n",
      "everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the other side of the\r\n",
      "deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house. The ship\r\n",
      "groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and\r\n",
      "cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural dislocation.\r\n",
      "In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable\r\n",
      "fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so low\r\n",
      "had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all\r\n",
      "approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to\r\n",
      "the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hold on, hold on, won't ye?\" cried Stubb to the body, \"don't be in such\r\n",
      "a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something or go\r\n",
      "for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes, and run\r\n",
      "one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big chains.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Knife? Aye, aye,\" cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter's heavy\r\n",
      "hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing\r\n",
      "at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were\r\n",
      "given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific\r\n",
      "snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm\r\n",
      "Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately\r\n",
      "accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great\r\n",
      "buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the\r\n",
      "surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and\r\n",
      "broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their\r\n",
      "bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that\r\n",
      "this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so\r\n",
      "sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it\r\n",
      "is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with\r\n",
      "noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of\r\n",
      "life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny, buoyant\r\n",
      "heroes do sometimes sink.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this\r\n",
      "accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty\r\n",
      "Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable in\r\n",
      "no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;\r\n",
      "his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this\r\n",
      "incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances\r\n",
      "where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale\r\n",
      "again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this\r\n",
      "is obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious\r\n",
      "magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship could\r\n",
      "hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings, among\r\n",
      "the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of sinking, they\r\n",
      "fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when the body has gone\r\n",
      "down, they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from\r\n",

      "preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this historical\r\n",
      "story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some sceptical Greeks\r\n",

      "equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale, and Arion and the\r\n",
      "dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those\r\n",
      "traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One old Sag-Harbor whaleman's chief reason for questioning the Hebrew\r\n",
      "story was this:--He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,\r\n",
      "embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented\r\n",
      "Jonah's whale with two spouts in his head--a peculiarity only true\r\n",
      "with respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the\r\n",
      "varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this\r\n",
      "saying, \"A penny roll would choke him\"; his swallow is so very small.\r\n",
      "But, to this, Bishop Jebb's anticipative answer is ready. It is not\r\n",
      "necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the\r\n",
      "whale's belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And\r\n",
      "this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the\r\n",
      "Right Whale's mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and\r\n",
      "comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have\r\n",
      "ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right\r\n",
      "Whale is toothless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his\r\n",
      "want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in\r\n",
      "reference to his incarcerated body and the whale's gastric juices. But\r\n",
      "this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist\r\n",
      "supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a\r\n",
      "DEAD whale--even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned\r\n",
      "their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has\r\n",
      "been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was\r\n",
      "thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his escape\r\n",
      "to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a figure-head;\r\n",
      "and, I would add, possibly called \"The Whale,\" as some craft are\r\n",
      "nowadays christened the \"Shark,\" the \"Gull,\" the \"Eagle.\" Nor have there\r\n",
      "been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned\r\n",
      "in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver--an inflated bag\r\n",
      "of wind--which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was saved from a\r\n",
      "watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all round. But\r\n",
      "he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was this, if I\r\n",
      "remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the Mediterranean\r\n",
      "Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days'\r\n",
      "journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much more than three\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that\r\n",
      "short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by the\r\n",
      "way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage through\r\n",
      "the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up the\r\n",
      "Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the complete\r\n",
      "circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of the Tigris\r\n",
      "waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any whale to\r\n",
      "swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah's weathering the Cape of Good Hope\r\n",
      "at so early a day would wrest the honour of the discovery of that great\r\n",
      "headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and so make\r\n",
      "modern history a liar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his\r\n",
      "foolish pride of reason--a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing\r\n",
      "that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the\r\n",
      "sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and\r\n",
      "abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a\r\n",
      "Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah's going to Nineveh\r\n",
      "via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of\r\n",
      "the general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly\r\n",

      "is seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful,\r\n",
      "on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as\r\n",
      "compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a\r\n",
      "general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before any\r\n",
      "pitchpoling comes into play.\r\n",

      "Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and\r\n",

      "him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand, thereby\r\n",
      "elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his\r\n",
      "palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,\r\n",
      "balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless\r\n",
      "impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming\r\n",

      "fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then\r\n",
      "live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the\r\n",
      "case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full\r\n",
      "hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or\r\n",
      "so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has\r\n",
      "no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine\r\n",
      "he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of\r\n",
      "vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are\r\n",
      "completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or more,\r\n",
      "a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of vitality in\r\n",
      "him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus\r\n",
      "supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs.\r\n",
      "The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable; and that the\r\n",
      "supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true, seems the more\r\n",
      "cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of\r\n",
      "that leviathan in HAVING HIS SPOUTINGS OUT, as the fishermen phrase\r\n",
      "it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising to the surface, the\r\n",
      "Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform\r\n",
      "with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven minutes, and\r\n",
      "jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then whenever he\r\n",
      "rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again, to\r\n",
      "a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him, so that\r\n",
      "he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular\r\n",
      "allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told, will he\r\n",
      "finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however, that\r\n",
      "in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one\r\n",
      "they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his\r\n",
      "spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere\r\n",
      "descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the\r\n",
      "whale's rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For\r\n",
      "not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing\r\n",
      "a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O\r\n",
      "hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In man, breathing is incessantly going on--one breath only serving\r\n",
      "for two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to\r\n",
      "attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the\r\n",
      "Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole; if\r\n",
      "it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water, then\r\n",
      "I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell\r\n",
      "seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at all\r\n",
      "answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so clogged\r\n",
      "with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power of\r\n",
      "smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout--whether it be water or\r\n",
      "whether it be vapour--no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on\r\n",
      "this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no proper\r\n",
      "olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no violets, no\r\n",
      "Cologne-water in the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting\r\n",
      "canal, and as that long canal--like the grand Erie Canal--is furnished\r\n",
      "with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of\r\n",
      "air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;\r\n",
      "unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles,\r\n",
      "he talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?\r\n",
      "Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to\r\n",
      "this world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a\r\n",
      "living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it\r\n",
      "is for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,\r\n",
      "horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little\r\n",
      "to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down\r\n",
      "in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether this\r\n",
      "gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout of the\r\n",
      "Sperm Whale is the mere vapour of the exhaled breath, or whether that\r\n",
      "exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and\r\n",
      "discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth indirectly\r\n",
      "communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be proved that this\r\n",
      "is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle. Because\r\n",
      "the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be, when in feeding he\r\n",
      "accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale's food is far beneath\r\n",
      "the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he would. Besides, if\r\n",
      "you regard him very closely, and time him with your watch, you will find\r\n",
      "that when unmolested, there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods\r\n",
      "of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!\r\n",
      "You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not\r\n",
      "tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to\r\n",
      "settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the\r\n",
      "knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand in\r\n",
      "it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping\r\n",
      "it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,\r\n",
      "when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view\r\n",
      "of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading\r\n",
      "all around him. And if at such times you should think that you really\r\n",
      "perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are\r\n",
      "not merely condensed from its vapour; or how do you know that they\r\n",
      "are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole\r\n",
      "fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale's head? For\r\n",
      "even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with\r\n",
      "his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary's in the desert; even then,\r\n",
      "the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under\r\n",
      "a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with\r\n",
      "rain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the\r\n",
      "precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering\r\n",
      "into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to\r\n",
      "this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into\r\n",
      "slight contact with the outer, vapoury shreds of the jet, which will\r\n",
      "often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of\r\n",
      "the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer\r\n",
      "contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view,\r\n",
      "or otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.\r\n",
      "Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to\r\n",
      "evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt\r\n",
      "it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind you.\r\n",
      "The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is to let\r\n",
      "this deadly spout alone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My\r\n",
      "hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides\r\n",
      "other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations\r\n",
      "touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale;\r\n",
      "I account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed\r\n",
      "fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other\r\n",
      "whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am\r\n",
      "convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as\r\n",
      "Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes\r\n",
      "up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep\r\n",
      "thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the\r\n",
      "curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected there,\r\n",
      "a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my\r\n",
      "head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep thought,\r\n",
      "after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an August noon;\r\n",
      "this seems an additional argument for the above supposition.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to\r\n",
      "behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild\r\n",
      "head overhung by a canopy of vapour, engendered by his incommunicable\r\n",
      "contemplations, and that vapour--as you will sometimes see it--glorified\r\n",
      "by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.\r\n",
      "For, d'ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate\r\n",
      "vapour. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my\r\n",
      "mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a\r\n",
      "heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;\r\n",
      "but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts\r\n",
      "of all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this\r\n",
      "combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who\r\n",
      "regards them both with equal eye.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,\r\n",
      "and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial, I\r\n",
      "celebrate a tail.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale's tail to begin at that point of\r\n",
      "the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises\r\n",
      "upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet. The\r\n",
      "compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat palms\r\n",
      "or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness.\r\n",
      "At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap, then sideways\r\n",
      "recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy between. In\r\n",
      "no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in\r\n",
      "the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost expansion in the\r\n",
      "full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut\r\n",
      "into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:--upper,\r\n",
      "middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are\r\n",
      "long and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running\r\n",
      "crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as\r\n",
      "anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman\r\n",
      "walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin\r\n",
      "course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful\r\n",
      "relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the\r\n",
      "great strength of the masonry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,\r\n",
      "the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of\r\n",
      "muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins\r\n",
      "and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and\r\n",
      "largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent\r\n",
      "measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.\r\n",
      "Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor does this--its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful\r\n",
      "flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through\r\n",
      "a Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most\r\n",
      "appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or harmony,\r\n",
      "but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly beautiful,\r\n",
      "strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied tendons that\r\n",
      "all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved Hercules, and its\r\n",
      "charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the\r\n",
      "naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the\r\n",
      "man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch. When Angelo paints even God\r\n",
      "the Father in human form, mark what robustness is there. And whatever\r\n",
      "they may reveal of the divine love in the Son, the soft, curled,\r\n",
      "hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which his idea has been most\r\n",
      "successfully embodied; these pictures, so destitute as they are of all\r\n",
      "brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but the mere negative, feminine\r\n",
      "one of submission and endurance, which on all hands it is conceded, form\r\n",
      "the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether\r\n",
      "wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it\r\n",
      "be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein no\r\n",
      "fairy's arm can transcend it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for\r\n",
      "progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;\r\n",
      "Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan's tail acts in\r\n",
      "a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never\r\n",
      "wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the\r\n",
      "whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled\r\n",
      "forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is this\r\n",
      "which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster when\r\n",
      "furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only\r\n",
      "fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his\r\n",
      "conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In\r\n",
      "striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the\r\n",
      "blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed\r\n",
      "air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply\r\n",
      "irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only\r\n",
      "salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the\r\n",
      "opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whale\r\n",
      "boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a dashed\r\n",
      "plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the most\r\n",
      "serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received in the\r\n",
      "fishery, that they are accounted mere child's play. Some one strips off\r\n",
      "a frock, and the hole is stopped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale\r\n",
      "the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect\r\n",
      "there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the\r\n",
      "elephant's trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of\r\n",
      "sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft\r\n",
      "slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface\r\n",
      "of the sea; and if he feel but a sailor's whisker, woe to that sailor,\r\n",
      "whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!\r\n",
      "Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of\r\n",
      "Darmonodes' elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with\r\n",
      "low salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their\r\n",
      "zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not\r\n",
      "possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet\r\n",
      "another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his trunk\r\n",
      "and extracted the dart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the\r\n",
      "middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence\r\n",
      "of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a\r\n",
      "hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of\r\n",
      "his tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the\r\n",
      "thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a great\r\n",
      "gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of vapour\r\n",
      "from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that that was\r\n",
      "the smoke from the touch-hole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes\r\n",
      "lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely\r\n",
      "out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into\r\n",
      "the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are\r\n",
      "tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they\r\n",
      "downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime BREACH--somewhere\r\n",
      "else to be described--this peaking of the whale's flukes is perhaps the\r\n",
      "grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless\r\n",
      "profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the\r\n",
      "highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting forth\r\n",
      "his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in\r\n",
      "gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in\r\n",
      "the Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the\r\n",
      "archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that\r\n",
      "crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,\r\n",
      "all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with\r\n",
      "peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment\r\n",
      "of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of\r\n",
      "the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African\r\n",
      "elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most devout\r\n",
      "of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military elephants of\r\n",
      "antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the\r\n",
      "profoundest silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the\r\n",
      "elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk\r\n",
      "of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two\r\n",
      "opposite organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they\r\n",
      "respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier\r\n",
      "to Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan's tail, his trunk is but the\r\n",
      "stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant's trunk were as\r\n",
      "the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and crash\r\n",
      "of the sperm whale's ponderous flukes, which in repeated instances have\r\n",
      "one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews\r\n",

      "white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with\r\n",

      "like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and\r\n",
      "go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling\r\n",
      "his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole,\r\n",

      "pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the swift\r\n",

      "her own chosen pursuit,--mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that they\r\n",

      "forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one the\r\n",
      "bloodthirsty pirates chasing him; some such fancy as the above seemed\r\n",
      "his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in\r\n",
      "which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that through that\r\n",
      "gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that through that\r\n",
      "same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end;\r\n",
      "and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and\r\n",
      "inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their\r\n",
      "curses;--when all these conceits had passed through his brain, Ahab's\r\n",
      "brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after some\r\n",
      "stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the firm\r\n",
      "thing from its place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and\r\n",

      "side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the\r\n",

      "upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained\r\n",
      "upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake of the whales, at\r\n",
      "length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the ship neared them;\r\n",
      "and the wind now dying away, word was passed to spring to the boats. But\r\n",
      "no sooner did the herd, by some presumed wonderful instinct of the Sperm\r\n",
      "Whale, become notified of the three keels that were after them,--though\r\n",
      "as yet a mile in their rear,--than they rallied again, and forming\r\n",
      "in close ranks and battalions, so that their spouts all looked like\r\n",
      "flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved on with redoubled velocity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and\r\n",
      "after several hours' pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase,\r\n",
      "when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating\r\n",
      "token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange\r\n",
      "perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive\r\n",
      "it in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns\r\n",
      "in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now\r\n",
      "broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus' elephants in the\r\n",
      "Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with consternation.\r\n",
      "In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles, and aimlessly\r\n",
      "swimming hither and thither, by their short thick spoutings, they\r\n",
      "plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was still more\r\n",
      "strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely paralysed\r\n",
      "as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled ships on the\r\n",
      "sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep, pursued over\r\n",
      "the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not possibly have evinced\r\n",
      "such excessive dismay. But this occasional timidity is characteristic\r\n",
      "of almost all herding creatures. Though banding together in tens of\r\n",
      "thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the West have fled before a\r\n",
      "solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human beings, how when herded\r\n",
      "together in the sheepfold of a theatre's pit, they will, at the\r\n",
      "slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the outlets, crowding,\r\n",
      "trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each other to death. Best,\r\n",
      "therefore, withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales\r\n",
      "before us, for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not\r\n",
      "infinitely outdone by the madness of men.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,\r\n",
      "yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor\r\n",
      "retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in\r\n",
      "those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one\r\n",
      "lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes' time,\r\n",
      "Queequeg's harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray\r\n",
      "in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered straight\r\n",
      "for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part of the\r\n",
      "whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise unprecedented; and\r\n",
      "indeed is almost always more or less anticipated; yet does it present\r\n",
      "one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. For as the swift\r\n",
      "monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal, you bid\r\n",
      "adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of\r\n",
      "speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we\r\n",
      "thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by\r\n",
      "the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was\r\n",
      "like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer\r\n",
      "through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what\r\n",
      "moment it may be locked in and crushed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off\r\n",
      "from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away\r\n",
      "from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the\r\n",
      "time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our\r\n",
      "way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no time\r\n",
      "to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their wonted\r\n",
      "duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to the\r\n",
      "shouting part of the business. \"Out of the way, Commodore!\" cried one,\r\n",
      "to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,\r\n",
      "and for an instant threatened to swamp us. \"Hard down with your tail,\r\n",
      "there!\" cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed\r\n",
      "calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented\r\n",
      "by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood\r\n",
      "of equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each\r\n",
      "other's grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then\r\n",
      "attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line\r\n",
      "being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is chiefly\r\n",
      "among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more whales\r\n",
      "are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But sperm\r\n",
      "whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you must\r\n",
      "kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you must wing\r\n",
      "them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure. Hence it\r\n",
      "is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat\r\n",
      "was furnished with three of them. The first and second were successfully\r\n",
      "darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly running off, fettered by the\r\n",
      "enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg. They were cramped like\r\n",
      "malefactors with the chain and ball. But upon flinging the third, in the\r\n",
      "act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block, it caught under one\r\n",
      "of the seats of the boat, and in an instant tore it out and carried it\r\n",
      "away, dropping the oarsman in the boat's bottom as the seat slid from\r\n",
      "under him. On both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks, but we\r\n",
      "stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for\r\n",
      "the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were\r\n",
      "it not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale's way greatly\r\n",
      "diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from the\r\n",
      "circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So that\r\n",
      "when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale sideways\r\n",
      "vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting momentum, we\r\n",
      "glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal, as if\r\n",
      "from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake. Here\r\n",
      "the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales, were heard\r\n",
      "but not felt. In this central expanse the sea presented that smooth\r\n",
      "satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by the subtle moisture\r\n",
      "thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods. Yes, we were now\r\n",
      "in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every\r\n",
      "commotion. And still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of\r\n",
      "the outer concentric circles, and saw successive pods of whales, eight\r\n",
      "or ten in each, swiftly going round and round, like multiplied spans of\r\n",
      "horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to shoulder, that a Titanic\r\n",
      "circus-rider might easily have over-arched the middle ones, and so have\r\n",
      "gone round on their backs. Owing to the density of the crowd of reposing\r\n",
      "whales, more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd, no\r\n",
      "possible chance of escape was at present afforded us. We must watch for\r\n",
      "a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in; the wall that had only\r\n",
      "admitted us in order to shut us up. Keeping at the centre of the lake,\r\n",
      "we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves; the women\r\n",
      "and children of this routed host.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving\r\n",
      "outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in\r\n",
      "any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by\r\n",
      "the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square\r\n",
      "miles. At any rate--though indeed such a test at such a time might be\r\n",
      "deceptive--spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that\r\n",

      "in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central\r\n",
      "circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was\r\n",

      "onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless; but\r\n",
      "the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales\r\n",
      "might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask had\r\n",

      "it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons\r\n",
      "and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)\r\n",
      "acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards\r\n",

      "Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning\r\n",
      "over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two hands\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! keep cool--cool? yes, that's the word! why don't you pack those\r\n",
      "whales in ice while you're working at 'em? But joking aside, though; do\r\n",
      "you know, Rose-bud, that it's all nonsense trying to get any oil out of\r\n",
      "such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn't a gill in his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I know that well enough; but, d'ye see, the Captain here won't believe\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,\" rejoined Stubb,\r\n",
      "and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene presented\r\n",
      "itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were getting the\r\n",
      "heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked rather slow\r\n",
      "and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good humor. All their\r\n",
      "noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jib-booms.\r\n",
      "Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up to the\r\n",
      "mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch the\r\n",
      "plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their\r\n",
      "nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short\r\n",
      "off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it\r\n",
      "constantly filled their olfactories.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from\r\n",
      "the Captain's round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a\r\n",
      "fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from within.\r\n",
      "This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain remonstrating\r\n",
      "against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself to the Captain's\r\n",
      "round-house (CABINET he called it) to avoid the pest; but still, could\r\n",
      "not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the\r\n",
      "Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate\r\n",
      "expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus,\r\n",
      "who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.\r\n",
      "Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man\r\n",
      "had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore\r\n",
      "held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and\r\n",
      "confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan\r\n",
      "for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all\r\n",
      "dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan\r\n",
      "of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter's office, was\r\n",
      "to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and as\r\n",
      "for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in\r\n",
      "him during the interview.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a\r\n",
      "small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with\r\n",
      "large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet vest\r\n",
      "with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now politely\r\n",
      "introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put on the\r\n",
      "aspect of interpreting between them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What shall I say to him first?\" said he.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why,\" said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, \"you\r\n",
      "may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,\r\n",
      "though I don't pretend to be a judge.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur,\" said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his\r\n",
      "captain, \"that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain\r\n",
      "and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a\r\n",
      "blasted whale they had brought alongside.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him\r\n",
      "carefully, I'm quite certain that he's no more fit to command a\r\n",
      "whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he's a\r\n",
      "baboon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one, is\r\n",
      "far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures us,\r\n",
      "as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his\r\n",
      "crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast loose\r\n",
      "the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What now?\" said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to\r\n",
      "them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that--that--in\r\n",
      "fact, tell him I've diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody\r\n",
      "else.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that he's very happy to have been of any service to\r\n",
      "us.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties\r\n",
      "(meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into his\r\n",
      "cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,\" said the interpreter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank him heartily; but tell him it's against my principles to drink\r\n",
      "with the man I've diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He says, Monsieur, that his principles won't admit of his drinking; but\r\n",
      "that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur had\r\n",
      "best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales, for\r\n",
      "it's so calm they won't drift.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed\r\n",
      "the Guernsey-man to this effect,--that having a long tow-line in his\r\n",
      "boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the lighter\r\n",
      "whale of the two from the ship's side. While the Frenchman's boats,\r\n",
      "then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb benevolently towed\r\n",
      "away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously slacking out a most\r\n",
      "unusually long tow-line.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;\r\n",
      "hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while the\r\n",
      "Pequod slid in between him and Stubb's whale. Whereupon Stubb quickly\r\n",
      "pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give notice of\r\n",
      "his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous\r\n",
      "cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an excavation in the\r\n",
      "body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost have thought he was\r\n",
      "digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at length his spade struck\r\n",
      "against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up old Roman tiles and\r\n",
      "pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat's crew were all in high\r\n",
      "excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking as anxious as\r\n",
      "gold-hunters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and\r\n",
      "screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning\r\n",
      "to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased, when\r\n",
      "suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a faint\r\n",
      "stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells without\r\n",
      "being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then along with\r\n",
      "another, without at all blending with it for a time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have it, I have it,\" cried Stubb, with delight, striking something in\r\n",
      "the subterranean regions, \"a purse! a purse!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls\r\n",
      "of something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old\r\n",
      "cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with\r\n",
      "your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good\r\n",
      "friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist.\r\n",
      "Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the\r\n",
      "sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as\r\n",
      "an article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain\r\n",
      "Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that\r\n",
      "subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,\r\n",
      "the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem\r\n",
      "to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for\r\n",
      "grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though\r\n",
      "at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland\r\n",
      "soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides,\r\n",
      "amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for\r\n",
      "mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft,\r\n",
      "waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in\r\n",
      "perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum.\r\n",
      "The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same\r\n",
      "purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter's in Rome. Some wine\r\n",
      "merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale\r\n",
      "themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick\r\n",
      "whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and\r\n",
      "by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such\r\n",
      "a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four\r\n",
      "boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out of harm's way, as\r\n",
      "laborers do in blasting rocks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris, certain\r\n",
      "hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be sailors'\r\n",
      "trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing\r\n",
      "more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be\r\n",
      "found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that\r\n",
      "saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;\r\n",
      "how that we are sown in dishonour, but raised in glory. And likewise\r\n",
      "call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh\r\n",
      "the best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of\r\n",
      "ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is the\r\n",
      "worst.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but cannot,\r\n",
      "owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen,\r\n",
      "and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds, might be\r\n",
      "considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of\r\n",
      "the Frenchman's two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous\r\n",
      "aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is throughout\r\n",
      "a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to rebut. They\r\n",
      "hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this odious stigma\r\n",
      "originate?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the\r\n",
      "Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because\r\n",
      "those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as\r\n",
      "the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in\r\n",
      "small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry\r\n",
      "it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas,\r\n",
      "and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding\r\n",
      "any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold,\r\n",
      "and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a\r\n",
      "savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an\r\n",
      "old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in-Hospital.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be\r\n",
      "likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former\r\n",
      "times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which\r\n",
      "latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great\r\n",
      "work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports (smeer,\r\n",
      "fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a\r\n",
      "place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without\r\n",
      "being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of\r\n",
      "furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full\r\n",
      "operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is\r\n",
      "quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four\r\n",
      "years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not,\r\n",
      "perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the\r\n",
      "state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that\r\n",
      "living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by\r\n",
      "no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the\r\n",
      "people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by\r\n",
      "the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant,\r\n",
      "when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance\r\n",
      "of exercise; always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the\r\n",
      "open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm Whale's flukes above water\r\n",
      "dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a\r\n",
      "warm parlor. What then shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance,\r\n",
      "considering his magnitude? Must it not be to that famous elephant, with\r\n",

      "to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as\r\n",
      "the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which\r\n",
      "happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip's seat. The\r\n",
      "involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in\r\n",
      "hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale\r\n",
      "line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as\r\n",
      "to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That\r\n",
      "instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly\r\n",
      "straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks\r\n",
      "of the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken\r\n",
      "several turns around his chest and neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He\r\n",
      "hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath,\r\n",
      "he suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,\r\n",
      "exclaimed interrogatively, \"Cut?\" Meantime Pip's blue, choked face\r\n",
      "plainly looked, Do, for God's sake! All passed in a flash. In less than\r\n",
      "half a minute, this entire thing happened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Damn him, cut!\" roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was\r\n",
      "saved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed\r\n",
      "by yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these\r\n",
      "irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,\r\n",
      "but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,\r\n",
      "unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never\r\n",
      "jump from a boat, Pip, except--but all the rest was indefinite, as the\r\n",
      "soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, STICK TO THE BOAT, is your\r\n",
      "true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when LEAP FROM\r\n",
      "THE BOAT, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if he\r\n",
      "should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be leaving\r\n",
      "him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly dropped\r\n",
      "all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, \"Stick to the boat,\r\n",
      "Pip, or by the Lord, I won't pick you up if you jump; mind that. We\r\n",
      "can't afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would sell for\r\n",
      "thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in mind, and\r\n",
      "don't jump any more.\" Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted, that\r\n",
      "though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal, which\r\n",
      "propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was\r\n",
      "under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this time\r\n",
      "he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started to\r\n",
      "run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller's trunk.\r\n",
      "Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful, bounteous,\r\n",
      "blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly stretching away,\r\n",
      "all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater's skin hammered out to the\r\n",
      "extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip's ebon head showed\r\n",
      "like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly\r\n",
      "astern. Stubb's inexorable back was turned upon him; and the whale was\r\n",
      "winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between\r\n",
      "Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor Pip turned his\r\n",
      "crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely castaway, though\r\n",
      "the loftiest and the brightest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the\r\n",
      "practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful\r\n",
      "lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the\r\n",
      "middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark, how\r\n",
      "when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea--mark how closely they\r\n",
      "hug their ship and only coast along her sides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No; he\r\n",
      "did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,\r\n",
      "and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip very\r\n",
      "quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations towards\r\n",
      "oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always manifested\r\n",
      "by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances not\r\n",
      "unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so\r\n",
      "called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to\r\n",
      "military navies and armies.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly\r\n",
      "spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and\r\n",
      "Stubb's boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent\r\n",
      "upon his fish, that Pip's ringed horizon began to expand around him\r\n",
      "miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him; but\r\n",
      "from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such, at\r\n",
      "least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body\r\n",
      "up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.\r\n",
      "Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of\r\n",
      "the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;\r\n",
      "and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the\r\n",
      "joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,\r\n",
      "God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters\r\n",
      "heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God's foot upon the treadle of the\r\n",
      "loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So man's\r\n",
      "insanity is heaven's sense; and wandering from all mortal reason, man\r\n",
      "comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is absurd and\r\n",
      "frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised, indifferent as his\r\n",

      "just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were open; I\r\n",

      "rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as\r\n",
      "rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered feeling, as of\r\n",
      "death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the tiller, but with\r\n",
      "the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in some enchanted way,\r\n",
      "inverted. My God! what is the matter with me? thought I. Lo! in my brief\r\n",
      "sleep I had turned myself about, and was fronting the ship's stern, with\r\n",
      "my back to her prow and the compass. In an instant I faced back, just\r\n",
      "in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind, and very\r\n",
      "probably capsizing her. How glad and how grateful the relief from this\r\n",
      "unnatural hallucination of the night, and the fatal contingency of being\r\n",
      "brought by the lee!\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to\r\n",

      "vessel at a moment's warning. Now, it is no very easy matter\r\n",
      "for anybody--except those who are almost hourly used to it, like\r\n",
      "whalemen--to clamber up a ship's side from a boat on the open sea; for\r\n",
      "the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks, and\r\n",

      "in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the\r\n",
      "two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the\r\n",
      "perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a\r\n",
      "pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem\r\n",

      "fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then giving the\r\n",
      "word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to hoist his\r\n",
      "own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running parts of\r\n",
      "the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks, and\r\n",
      "gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm frankly thrust\r\n",

      "truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw; more\r\n",

      "that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I know\r\n",
      "that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark ye,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend's,\" cried Bunger, stoopingly\r\n",

      "whole globe who so harpooned him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape\r\n",

      "and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were thrown open.\r\n",
      "But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable house again\r\n",
      "bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons--how many, their mother only\r\n",
      "knows--and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I think, at their\r\n",
      "expense, the British government was induced to send the sloop-of-war\r\n",

      "somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the\r\n",
      "forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps--every\r\n",

      "jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the\r\n",
      "howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts\r\n",
      "did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that we\r\n",
      "had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting down\r\n",

      "bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for\r\n",
      "certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,\r\n",
      "symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that you\r\n",
      "could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were swallowed.\r\n",
      "If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their pitching out\r\n",
      "of you like billiard-balls. The bread--but that couldn't be helped;\r\n",

      "joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing?\r\n",
      "I will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers\r\n",
      "is matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of\r\n",
      "historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,\r\n",
      "Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant\r\n",
      "in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions,\r\n",
      "touching plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English\r\n",
      "merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence, in\r\n",
      "the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural,\r\n",

      "origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further elucidated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an\r\n",
      "ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I\r\n",
      "knew must be about whalers. The title was, \"Dan Coopman,\" wherefore I\r\n",
      "concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam\r\n",
      "cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was\r\n",
      "reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one\r\n",
      "\"Fitz Swackhammer.\" But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,\r\n",
      "professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus and\r\n",
      "St. Pott's, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a box\r\n",
      "of sperm candles for his trouble--this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as he\r\n",
      "spied the book, assured me that \"Dan Coopman\" did not mean \"The Cooper,\"\r\n",
      "but \"The Merchant.\" In short, this ancient and learned Low Dutch book\r\n",
      "treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other subjects, contained\r\n",
      "a very interesting account of its whale fishery. And in this chapter it\r\n",
      "was, headed, \"Smeer,\" or \"Fat,\" that I found a long detailed list of the\r\n",
      "outfits for the larders and cellars of 180 sail of Dutch whalemen; from\r\n",
      "which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead, I transcribe the following:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock\r\n",
      "fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins\r\n",
      "of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese\r\n",
      "(probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of\r\n",
      "beer.\r\n",

      "Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in\r\n",
      "the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole pipes,\r\n",
      "barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all\r\n",
      "this beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were\r\n",
      "incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic\r\n",
      "application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my\r\n",
      "own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by\r\n",
      "every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen\r\n",
      "whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and\r\n",
      "Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their\r\n",
      "naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the\r\n",
      "nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game\r\n",
      "in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux country\r\n",
      "where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil.\r\n",

      "The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those\r\n",
      "polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that\r\n",
      "climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,\r\n",
      "including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not much\r\n",
      "exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their fleet\r\n",
      "of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I say,\r\n",

      "sized Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful\r\n",
      "calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between\r\n",
      "eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty\r\n",
      "feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least\r\n",

      "Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,\r\n",
      "jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now\r\n",
      "simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his\r\n",
      "unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large\r\n",
      "a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the\r\n",
      "most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in\r\n",
      "this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under your\r\n",
      "arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the\r\n",
      "general structure we are about to view.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In length, the Sperm Whale's skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two\r\n",
      "Feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have\r\n",
      "been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one\r\n",
      "fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two feet,\r\n",
      "his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty feet of\r\n",
      "plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less than a\r\n",
      "third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once\r\n",
      "enclosed his vitals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,\r\n",
      "extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled\r\n",
      "the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some twenty\r\n",
      "of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise, for the\r\n",
      "time, but a long, disconnected timber.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck,\r\n",
      "was nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each\r\n",
      "successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one\r\n",
      "of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From\r\n",
      "that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only\r\n",
      "spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore\r\n",
      "a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most\r\n",
      "arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay\r\n",
      "footpath bridges over small streams.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the\r\n",
      "circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of\r\n",
      "the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of\r\n",
      "the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the fish\r\n",
      "which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of the\r\n",
      "invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen\r\n",
      "feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight\r\n",
      "feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the\r\n",
      "living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I now saw\r\n",
      "but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with tons of\r\n",
      "added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for the\r\n",
      "ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of the\r\n",
      "weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try\r\n",
      "to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead\r\n",
      "attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in the\r\n",
      "heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry\r\n",

      "be truly and livingly found out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a\r\n",
      "crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now\r\n",
      "it's done, it looks much like Pompey's Pillar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are forty and odd vertebrae in all, which in the skeleton are\r\n",
      "not locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on\r\n",
      "a Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest,\r\n",
      "a middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth\r\n",
      "more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the\r\n",
      "tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white\r\n",
      "billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they\r\n",
      "had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest's children,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,\r\n",

      "the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation. A sailor takes\r\n",
      "a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the carpenter drills his ears.\r\n",
      "Another has the toothache: the carpenter out pincers, and clapping\r\n",
      "one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there; but the poor fellow\r\n",

      "premeditated reference to this world or the next. You might almost\r\n",
      "say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of\r\n",
      "unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to work so\r\n",
      "much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been tutored to\r\n",
      "it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but merely by\r\n",
      "a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a pure\r\n",
      "manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early\r\n",

      "contrivances, assuming the exterior--though a little swelled--of a\r\n",

      "but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,\r\n",

      "stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated away to\r\n",

      "uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form the\r\n",

      "sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.\r\n",
      "No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial\r\n",

      "groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along\r\n",
      "with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,\r\n",
      "biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh water\r\n",
      "was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in\r\n",
      "the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for a\r\n",
      "pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that he\r\n",
      "might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without moving\r\n",
      "a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little\r\n",
      "god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo between, he\r\n",
      "called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed over him.\r\n",
      "The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay Queequeg\r\n",

      "was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now\r\n",
      "that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon\r\n",
      "there seemed no need of the carpenter's box: and thereupon, when some\r\n",
      "expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the\r\n",
      "cause of his sudden convalescence was this;--at a critical moment, he\r\n",
      "had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;\r\n",
      "and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,\r\n",
      "he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter of\r\n",
      "his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a word,\r\n",
      "it was Queequeg's conceit, that if a man made up his mind to live, mere\r\n",
      "sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale, or some\r\n",
      "violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;\r\n",
      "that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,\r\n",

      "sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a\r\n",
      "vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms\r\n",

      "springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,\r\n",
      "pronounced himself fit for a fight.\r\n",

      "the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some fathoms of\r\n",
      "it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension. Pressing\r\n",

      "intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope--like the Three\r\n",

      "both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his cabin,\r\n",

      "or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one. It\r\n",

      "At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb's face slowly beginning\r\n",
      "to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: \"See! see!\" and once\r\n",
      "more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled\r\n",
      "supernaturalness in their pallor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The corpusants have mercy on us all,\" cried Stubb, again.\r\n",

      "At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,\r\n",

      "they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,\r\n",
      "arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a\r\n",

      "attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running skeletons in\r\n",

      "upcast.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to pick up the\r\n",
      "majority first. But the captain, for some unknown constitutional reason,\r\n",

      "these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from verbally\r\n",
      "expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I will have the first sight of the whale myself,\"--he said. \"Aye!\r\n",
      "Ahab must have the doubloon! and with his own hands he rigged a nest\r\n",
      "of basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved\r\n",
      "block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the\r\n",
      "downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for\r\n",
      "the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with that\r\n",
      "end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round upon\r\n",
      "his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long upon\r\n",
      "Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then settling his\r\n",
      "firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,--\"Take the rope, sir--I give\r\n",
      "it into thy hands, Starbuck.\" Then arranging his person in the basket,\r\n",
      "he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch, Starbuck being\r\n",
      "the one who secured the rope at last; and afterwards stood near it. And\r\n",
      "thus, with one hand clinging round the royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad\r\n",
      "upon the sea for miles and miles,--ahead, astern, this side, and\r\n",
      "that,--within the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height.\r\n",

      "the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is\r\n",
      "hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these\r\n",
      "circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge\r\n",
      "to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such a\r\n",
      "wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations aloft\r\n",
      "cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the\r\n",
      "deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few minutes\r\n",
      "cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural fatality, if,\r\n",
      "unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor should by some\r\n",
      "carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the\r\n",
      "sea. So Ahab's proceedings in this matter were not unusual; the only\r\n",
      "strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck, almost the one\r\n",
      "only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the\r\n",
      "slightest degree approaching to decision--one of those too, whose\r\n",

      "strange, that this was the very man he should select for his watchman;\r\n",
      "freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted person's\r\n",
      "hands.\r\n",

      "Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten\r\n",
      "minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly\r\n",
      "incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these\r\n",
      "latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head\r\n",
      "in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a thousand feet\r\n",
      "straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and went eddying\r\n",
      "again round his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed\r\n",
      "not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked\r\n",
      "it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "accounted good. Ahab's hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on and\r\n",
      "on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared; while\r\n",

      "and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the\r\n",
      "main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the\r\n",

      "Moby Dick!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three\r\n",
      "look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous\r\n",
      "whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final\r\n",
      "perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just\r\n",
      "beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian's\r\n",
      "head was almost on a level with Ahab's heel. From this height the whale\r\n",
      "was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing\r\n",
      "his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into the\r\n",
      "air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had\r\n",
      "so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And did none of ye see it before?\" cried Ahab, hailing the perched men\r\n",
      "all around him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I\r\n",
      "cried out,\" said Tashtego.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not the same instant; not the same--no, the doubloon is mine, Fate\r\n",

      "White Whale first. There she blows!--there she blows!--there she blows!\r\n",
      "There again!--there again!\" he cried, in long-drawn, lingering, methodic\r\n",
      "tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale's visible jets.\r\n",
      "\"He's going to sound! In stunsails! Down top-gallant-sails! Stand by\r\n",
      "three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay on board, and keep the ship.\r\n",
      "Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So; steady, man, steady! There go\r\n",
      "flukes! No, no; only black water! All ready the boats there? Stand by,\r\n",
      "stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck; lower, lower,--quick, quicker!\" and he\r\n",
      "slid through the air to the deck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He is heading straight to leeward, sir,\" cried Stubb, \"right away from\r\n",
      "us; cannot have seen the ship yet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!--brace up!\r\n",
      "Shiver her!--shiver her!--So; well that! Boats, boats!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon all the boats but Starbuck's were dropped; all the boat-sails\r\n",
      "set--all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to\r\n",
      "leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up\r\n",
      "Fedallah's sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;\r\n",
      "but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew\r\n",
      "still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a\r\n",
      "noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter came\r\n",
      "so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling hump\r\n",
      "was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing,\r\n",
      "and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy, greenish\r\n",
      "foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head\r\n",
      "beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged waters, went\r\n",
      "the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky forehead, a musical\r\n",
      "rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and behind, the blue waters\r\n",
      "interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake;\r\n",
      "and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side. But\r\n",
      "these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly\r\n",
      "feathering the sea, alternate with their fitful flight; and like to\r\n",
      "some flag-staff rising from the painted hull of an argosy, the tall but\r\n",
      "shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whale's back;\r\n",
      "and at intervals one of the cloud of soft-toed fowls hovering, and\r\n",
      "to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish, silently perched and\r\n",
      "rocked on this pole, the long tail feathers streaming like pennons.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A gentle joyousness--a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested\r\n",
      "the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with\r\n",
      "ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering\r\n",
      "eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,\r\n",
      "rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that\r\n",
      "great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so\r\n",
      "divinely swam.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On each soft side--coincident with the parted swell, that but once\r\n",
      "leaving him, then flowed so wide away--on each bright side, the whale\r\n",
      "shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who\r\n",
      "namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured\r\n",
      "to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of\r\n",
      "tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all\r\n",
      "who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way\r\n",
      "thou may'st have bejuggled and destroyed before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among\r\n",
      "waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby\r\n",
      "Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his\r\n",
      "submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.\r\n",
      "But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an instant\r\n",
      "his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia's Natural\r\n",
      "Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air, the\r\n",
      "grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight. Hoveringly\r\n",
      "halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls longingly lingered\r\n",
      "over the agitated pool that he left.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift, the\r\n",
      "three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick's reappearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An hour,\" said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat's stern; and he gazed\r\n",
      "beyond the whale's place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing\r\n",
      "vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed\r\n",
      "whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze now\r\n",
      "freshened; the sea began to swell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The birds!--the birds!\" cried Tashtego.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were\r\n",
      "now all flying towards Ahab's boat; and when within a few yards began\r\n",
      "fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,\r\n",
      "expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man's; Ahab could discover\r\n",
      "no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down into its\r\n",
      "depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white\r\n",
      "weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it rose,\r\n",
      "till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked\r\n",
      "rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the undiscoverable\r\n",
      "bottom. It was Moby Dick's open mouth and scrolled jaw; his vast,\r\n",
      "shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea. The\r\n",
      "glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble\r\n",
      "tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled\r\n",
      "the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon\r\n",
      "Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and\r\n",
      "seizing Perth's harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and\r\n",
      "stand by to stern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis, its\r\n",
      "bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale's head while yet\r\n",
      "under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that\r\n",
      "malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted himself,\r\n",
      "as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath\r\n",
      "the boat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for\r\n",
      "an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of\r\n",
      "a biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his\r\n",
      "mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into\r\n",
      "the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish\r\n",
      "pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab's\r\n",
      "head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale\r\n",
      "now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With\r\n",
      "unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the\r\n",
      "tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other's heads to gain the\r\n",
      "uttermost stern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the\r\n",
      "whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his\r\n",
      "body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from\r\n",
      "the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and\r\n",
      "while the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis\r\n",
      "impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with\r\n",
      "this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and\r\n",
      "helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized\r\n",
      "the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from\r\n",
      "its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the\r\n",
      "frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an\r\n",
      "enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in twain,\r\n",
      "and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the two\r\n",
      "floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the crew\r\n",
      "at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold fast\r\n",
      "to the oars to lash them across.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first\r\n",
      "to perceive the whale's intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a\r\n",
      "movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand\r\n",
      "had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only\r\n",
      "slipping further into the whale's mouth, and tilting over sideways as it\r\n",
      "slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him out of\r\n",
      "it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little\r\n",
      "distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the\r\n",
      "billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;\r\n",
      "so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose--some twenty or more feet\r\n",
      "out of the water--the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,\r\n",
      "dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray\r\n",
      "still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel\r\n",
      "billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to\r\n",
      "overleap its summit with their scud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "*This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its designation\r\n",
      "(pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary up-and-down\r\n",
      "poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called pitchpoling, previously\r\n",
      "described. By this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively\r\n",
      "view whatever objects may be encircling him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round\r\n",
      "and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful\r\n",
      "wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault.\r\n",
      "The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the blood of\r\n",
      "grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus's elephants in the book\r\n",
      "of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the whale's\r\n",
      "insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,--though he could still\r\n",
      "keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that; helpless\r\n",
      "Ahab's head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock\r\n",
      "might burst. From the boat's fragmentary stern, Fedallah incuriously and\r\n",
      "mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other drifting end, could not\r\n",
      "succor him; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves.\r\n",
      "For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale's aspect, and so\r\n",
      "planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made, that he seemed\r\n",
      "horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other boats, unharmed,\r\n",
      "still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into the eddy to\r\n",
      "strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of\r\n",
      "the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that case could they\r\n",
      "themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then, they remained on\r\n",
      "the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had now become the old\r\n",
      "man's head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship's\r\n",
      "mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;\r\n",
      "and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!--\"Sail on\r\n",
      "the\"--but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and\r\n",
      "whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing\r\n",
      "to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,--\"Sail on the whale!--Drive him\r\n",
      "off!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Pequod's prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle, she\r\n",
      "effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly swam\r\n",
      "off, the boats flew to the rescue.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dragged into Stubb's boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white brine\r\n",
      "caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab's bodily strength did\r\n",
      "crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body's doom: for a time, lying\r\n",
      "all crushed in the bottom of Stubb's boat, like one trodden under foot\r\n",
      "of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from him, as\r\n",
      "desolate sounds from out ravines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more\r\n",
      "abbreviate it. In an instant's compass, great hearts sometimes condense\r\n",
      "to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused\r\n",
      "through feebler men's whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary\r\n",
      "in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their\r\n",
      "life-time aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous\r\n",
      "intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures\r\n",
      "contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The harpoon,\" said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on one\r\n",
      "bended arm--\"is it safe?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,\" said Stubb, showing it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lay it before me;--any missing men?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One, two, three, four, five;--there were five oars, sir, and here are\r\n",
      "five men.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's good.--Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!\r\n",

      "the helm!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked\r\n",
      "up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is thus\r\n",
      "continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now. But\r\n",
      "the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale,\r\n",
      "for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with a\r\n",
      "velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these circumstances,\r\n",
      "pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged, if not a\r\n",
      "hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long a period, such an\r\n",
      "unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing barely tolerable\r\n",
      "only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself, then, as it\r\n",
      "sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate means of\r\n",
      "overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her, and were\r\n",
      "soon swayed up to their cranes--the two parts of the wrecked boat having\r\n",
      "been previously secured by her--and then hoisting everything to her\r\n",
      "side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways outstretching it\r\n",
      "with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an albatross; the\r\n",
      "Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At the well known,\r\n",
      "methodic intervals, the whale's glittering spout was regularly announced\r\n",
      "from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be reported as just gone\r\n",
      "down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing the deck, binnacle-watch\r\n",
      "in hand, so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired, his\r\n",
      "voice was heard.--\"Whose is the doubloon now? D'ye see him?\" and if the\r\n",
      "reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded them to lift him to his\r\n",
      "perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now aloft and motionless;\r\n",
      "anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men aloft,\r\n",
      "or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a still\r\n",
      "greater breadth--thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat, at\r\n",
      "every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped upon\r\n",
      "the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered stern.\r\n",
      "At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded sky fresh\r\n",
      "troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old man's face\r\n",
      "there now stole some such added gloom as this.\r\n",

      "evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in\r\n",
      "his Captain's mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed--\"The\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "seek out the thing that might destroy them!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?\" cried Ahab, when, after\r\n",

      "bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not\r\n",
      "by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the White\r\n",
      "Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous phenomenon\r\n",

      "the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of\r\n",
      "air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows his place to the\r\n",

      "act of defiance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There she breaches! there she breaches!\" was the cry, as in his\r\n",
      "immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to\r\n",
      "Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved\r\n",
      "against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised, for\r\n",
      "the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and\r\n",

      "intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!\" cried Ahab, \"thy hour and\r\n",

      "The boats!--stand by!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped from\r\n",
      "his perch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lower away,\" he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat--a spare one,\r\n",

      "away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first\r\n",
      "assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the\r\n",
      "three crews. Ahab's boat was central; and cheering his men, he told them\r\n",
      "he would take the whale head-and-head,--that is, pull straight up to his\r\n",
      "forehead,--a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit, such\r\n",
      "a course excludes the coming onset from the whale's sidelong vision.\r\n",
      "But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three boats were\r\n",
      "plain as the ship's three masts to his eye; the White Whale churning\r\n",
      "himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were, rushing\r\n",
      "among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered appalling\r\n",
      "battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him from every\r\n",
      "boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which\r\n",
      "those boats were made. But skilfully manoeuvred, incessantly wheeling\r\n",
      "like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while eluded him;\r\n",
      "though, at times, but by a plank's breadth; while all the time, Ahab's\r\n",
      "unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed\r\n",
      "and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three\r\n",
      "lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,\r\n",
      "warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now\r\n",
      "for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more\r\n",
      "tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more\r\n",
      "line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again--hoping\r\n",
      "that way to disencumber it of some snarls--when lo!--a sight more savage\r\n",
      "than the embattled teeth of sharks!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Caught and twisted--corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons\r\n",
      "and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing\r\n",
      "and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab's boat. Only one\r\n",
      "thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached\r\n",
      "within--through--and then, without--the rays of steel; dragged in\r\n",
      "the line beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice\r\n",
      "sundering the rope near the chocks--dropped the intercepted fagot of\r\n",
      "steel into the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White\r\n",
      "Whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines;\r\n",
      "by so doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and\r\n",
      "Flask towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on\r\n",
      "a surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in\r\n",
      "a boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of\r\n",
      "the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly\r\n",
      "stirred bowl of punch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after\r\n",
      "the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while\r\n",
      "aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching his\r\n",
      "legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was lustily\r\n",
      "singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old man's\r\n",
      "line--now parting--admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to\r\n",
      "rescue whom he could;--in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand\r\n",
      "concreted perils,--Ahab's yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards\r\n",
      "Heaven by invisible wires,--as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly\r\n",
      "from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its\r\n",
      "bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell\r\n",
      "again--gunwale downwards--and Ahab and his men struggled out from under\r\n",
      "it, like seals from a sea-side cave.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first uprising momentum of the whale--modifying its direction as\r\n",
      "he struck the surface--involuntarily launched him along it, to a little\r\n",
      "distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his\r\n",
      "back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from\r\n",
      "side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip\r\n",
      "or crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and\r\n",
      "came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work\r\n",
      "for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the\r\n",
      "ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his\r\n",
      "leeward way at a traveller's methodic pace.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again\r\n",
      "came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the\r\n",
      "floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at, and\r\n",
      "safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists, and\r\n",
      "ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances; inextricable\r\n",
      "intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these were there;\r\n",
      "but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one. As\r\n",
      "with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to\r\n",
      "his boat's broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy float; nor\r\n",
      "did it so exhaust him as the previous day's mishap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as\r\n",
      "instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of\r\n",
      "Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory\r\n",

      "\"The ferrule has not stood, sir,\" said the carpenter, now coming up; \"I\r\n",
      "put good work into that leg.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But no bones broken, sir, I hope,\" said Stubb with true concern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!--d'ye see it.--But even with\r\n",
      "a broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of\r\n",
      "mine one jot more me, than this dead one that's lost. Nor white whale,\r\n",
      "nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the\r\n",

      "those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them in\r\n",
      "the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching\r\n",

      "barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the\r\n",

      "when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be sure\r\n",

      "expectant,--fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,\r\n",

      "subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with\r\n",
      "trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,\r\n",
      "but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist, it\r\n",
      "hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping back\r\n",
      "into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for\r\n",
      "an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of\r\n",

      "from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad\r\n",
      "white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;\r\n",
      "as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more\r\n",
      "flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two\r\n",

      "but leaving Ahab's almost without a scar.\r\n",

      "whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he\r\n",
      "shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round\r\n",
      "and round to the fish's back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in which,\r\n",
      "during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines\r\n",
      "around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his sable raiment\r\n",

      "corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter had\r\n",
      "been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again steadily\r\n",
      "swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,--which thus far had\r\n",
      "been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the present\r\n",
      "her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his utmost\r\n",

      "sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh! Ahab,\" cried Starbuck, \"not too late is it, even now, the third\r\n",

      "leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and follow\r\n",
      "him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards, he\r\n",
      "saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three\r\n",
      "mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats\r\n",
      "which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in\r\n",
      "repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he sped,\r\n",
      "he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying themselves\r\n",
      "on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all this; as he\r\n",
      "heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers seemed driving\r\n",
      "a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking that the vane or\r\n",
      "flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to Tashtego, who had\r\n",
      "just gained that perch, to descend again for another flag, and a hammer\r\n",
      "and nails, and so nail it to the mast.\r\n",
